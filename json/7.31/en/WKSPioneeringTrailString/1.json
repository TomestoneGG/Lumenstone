The Moongate Hub, base of our interstellar operations, is but newly constructed, and as such our facilities are skeleton in nature, from the hangars that house our machinery (perhaps one day advanced enough to propel us into the great unknown!) to the stores which offer our workers the materials they need for their projects.\n\nIndeed, our greatest concern at present is the small meteor showers that occasionally pepper our tents on Sinus Ardorum... Quality of fabric notwithstanding, one cannot imagine achieving our goals huddled beneath such fragile infrastructure!\n\nIt will be the work of our talented friends from Etheirys that sees our plans to fruition. May these long-lived dreams prosper!"

Not to mention the cohort of esteemed gleaners, adventurers, and artisans─a more diverse populace I have never seen!\n\nIt is thanks to everyone's diligence that we have been able to transform our modest Moongate Hub into something more established. A Base Camp Beta, if you will. Gone are our feeble tents, replaced by sturdy metal roofing! We need not fear the occasional meteorite as once we did.\n\nWith ample talent at our disposal, we have taken our inaugural steps with no little pride or success. I wait with bated breath to witness how our endeavors unfold outside the Moongate Hub."

Yet the facilities we create here serve not only as a mooring point for our interstellar aspirations, but a testing site for the challenges we may face on foreign stars.\n\nIn this sense, our successful construction of the Cosmoliner may prove to be our most instrumental boon. As we cannot yet confirm the presence of stable aetheric confluences on distant stars, we must have an alternative means of transportation at our disposal. The Cosmoliner provides us with just that, and hopefully we will witness the day when it spans the entirety of Sinus Ardorum."

I repeat: you need not fear unwanted exhilaration whilst residing in this humble abode.\n\nAs for the cosmoport, it is a triumph of Sharlayan's latest technology. Apparently, there exist faint confluences of aether within space, to which the cosmoport will guide any starfaring vessel, and whilst this model is still primitive, it carries us one step further towards interstellar travel!
