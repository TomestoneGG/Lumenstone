    "Description": "In the year 1497 of the Sixth Astral Era, a Lominsan Sea Wolf explorer of not twenty summers plotted a westward course for Hingashi, embarking on a fateful voyage that would catapult him into the ranks of legend. Unbeknownst to him and his crew, a great continent lay between them and the Far East─and it was not the splendor of Kugane, but the shores of Tural that ultimately lay upon the horizon.\n\nHaving made landfall, Ketenramm roamed the interior, ultimately reaching Mamook, the vast home of the Mamool Ja. There he met then-Autarch Gulool Ja Ja, with whom he struck up a firm friendship. Together, the pair ranged the length and breadth of Tural, spurred on by the same adventurous spirit that led the old sailor to this mysterious isle.",

He pledged to join Ketenramm's expedition soon after being roused from his sarcophagus in the phantom village, though it remains to be seen whether he will prove a useful asset, as the \"wise old man\" struggles to recall most of his allegedly nigh-infinite knowledge─a result of lingering grogginess from his lengthy slumber, or some other arcane process?",

This notion itself was eventually disputed when credible reports of the limbed shark began to flood in.\n\nAs if its very existence was not strange enough, a curious rumor surrounds the creature: allegedly, the petalodus will resist the temptation to devour any fleshy morsel it identifies as a friend. Individual attempts to verify said rumor have thus far ended predictably.",

Some naturalists posit that the need is nutritional, while others suggest the creatures simply enjoy burdening their interlocutors with unreasonable demands.

Details regarding the mythic idol's creation have always been shrouded in mystery. Records indicate that even the people of Skalla, who often utilized such constructs, were unaware of their provenance. Given that Gyr Abania has long been a hub for trade with the East, there is every likelihood that the underlying technology was developed in foreign lands and deliberately kept secret.",
