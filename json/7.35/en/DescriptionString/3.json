At least 15 sacramental offerings must be collected in order to challenge this duty.\n\nOnce a party leader has acquired sufficient offerings, they must form a four-player party with Disciples of War or Magic of level 100 or above and speak with Vanthau to invoke the Final Verse (Quantum). After selecting at least 15 offerings, Eminent Grief may be summoned and the duty commenced.\n\nPlease note that phoenix down cannot be used during the Final Verse (Quantum)."
