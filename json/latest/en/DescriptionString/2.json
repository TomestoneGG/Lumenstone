However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.\n\nBy waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.\n\nDemand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.\n\n\n\u25A0Start the Season Short and Efficient\nLevels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.\n\nTo quickly activate efficiency bonuses, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.\n\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: #ffff66;\u0022\u003EStrategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.\u003C/span\u003E"
