The changes you can expect to find are outlined below, using the Palace of the Dead as a contrasting example.\n\n<span style=\"color: #f1c600;\">■Floors</span>\nThe Palace of the Dead has a total of two hundred floors, whereas Pilgrim's Traverse has one hundred areas available for exploration.\n\n<span style=\"color: #f1c600;\">■Entry Points</span>\nYou may re-enter the dungeon from waypoints should your party KO or if you reset your progress. These entry points become available after clearing certain areas and completing quests unlocked by dungeon progression.\n\nIn the Palace of the Dead, players can only re-enter from floors 1 or 51. Pilgrim's Traverse offers entry points from stones 1, 21, 31, 51, and 71.\n\n<span style=\"color: #f1c600;\">■Matched Parties</span>\nAll floors after floor 100 of the Palace of the Dead are designed strictly as a challenge for players and only accessible to fixed parties. However, Pilgrim's Traverse allows players to challenge comparable areas, beginning with stone 31, with matched parties. Please note that from stone 91 onwards, the matching system cannot be used to add members.\n\n<span style=\"color: #f1c600;\">■Independent Duties</span>\nTwo independent duties can be unlocked by proceeding through Pilgrim's Traverse. Tabs with more information on each will be added to this menu when they are unlocked."
