    "Name": "Whom the Silkie Serves",
    "Description": "What a surprise to learn that the old palace silkie was a creation of Mother\u0027s! The discovery impelled me to pursue the topic with Papashan, who, of anyone besides Father, knew my mother best of all. Naturally, I was circumspect in my inquiries, lest he become aware of my subterranean explorations. \nWith fond remembrance, Papashan spoke of Mother\u0027s penchant for cleaning\u2500a habit she refused to surrender even after taking up residence in the royal chambers. Her ladies-in-waiting were positively scandalized, and hid away every brush and broom that the sultana\u0027s hands not be sullied by common grime. Denied the usual tools of sanitation, Mother retaliated by employing a Sharlayan tutor, whereby she acquired the arts necessary to manifest a massive, mouselike familiar. Ingrained with an obsessive dislike of dirt, this arcane entity would even corner the palace guards to scrub spots from their armor\u2500to the great amusement of the household staff. Then one day, without fanfare, the silkie was simply gone.\nI suspect the cause of its disappearance lay in the deepening conflict with the Monetarists; with less and less time to slip away from the palace, Mother likely set her familiar to protect and maintain the secret garden in her absence. Yet what a stubborn and willful soul she was! To create a servant for cleaning is one thing, but to imbue it with such unbridled power is quite another!",

    "Description": "With a mind to prepare for future explorations, I began trawling through the palace archives in search of documents with even a tangential mention of Sil\u0027dih. For the most part, however, the shelves held little in the way of new information. The only account to snare my attention was that of an Ul\u0027dahn soldier, who had written of his experiences fighting alongside the Amalj\u0027aa during the zombie purge. His report touched upon the different approach his new allies took to warfare, and how those differences impeded their cooperative efforts.\nIt was said that the undead which flooded the waterways were beyond counting, and varied wildly in individual strength. The most effective strategy, or so this soldier believed, was to focus their efforts on the weaker zombies, and thus whittle the horde down to a more manageable size. Not so the Amalj\u0027aa. When presented with the choice, the proud warriors would always seek to slay the mightiest enemies first. This display of superiority, they explained to the exasperated Ul\u0027dahn, was the best way to wage war. To do otherwise\u2500to begin an engagement with the lesser foe\u2500would cast doubt upon one\u0027s martial prowess.\n\u0027Twould seem they learned to respect each other\u0027s reasoning, yet ultimately fought their battles as their peoples preferred. The Ul\u0027dahn soldier returned to his former tactic, targeting the weakest undead for his initial assaults. An interesting point of culture, mayhap, but a helpful one? That remains to be seen.",

Yet the reason behind the design\u0027s similarity has naught to do with sibling imitation. In Belah\u0027dia\u0027s time, \u0027twas the Flame of Magic and the Fruit of Knowledge which sat the scales of judgment. Ul\u0027dah took the Flame as its own, balancing the scales with the Gem of Affluence, whilst Sil\u0027dih claimed the Fruit, and set it against the Helm of Might. Each thought himself the rightful heir, and thus did both raise flags depicting the bounties of Belah\u0027dia.\nBoth included a symbol of strength, but the difference lay in its interpretation: Ul\u0027dah believed in the potency of its magicks; Sil\u0027dih, in its military might. The gladiators who train in our Coliseum are mayhap the closest embodiment of Sil\u0027dihn philosophy. \nIn fact, reflecting on the encounter now, the fierce gladiator construct lurking in the palace depths could not have been a more apt incarnation of their beliefs: from the exquisite embossment of grapes upon its formidable helm, to the way its gleaming form\u2500the same silvery hue as Sil\u0027dih\u0027s scales\u2500illuminated the subterranean gloom.

Knowing no honest man would be skulking about at this hour, they approached with caution\u2500to find no man at all, but a single lantern, lying lonely and unattended. With some thought of preventing a fire, one of the samurai reached down to claim it.\nIn an instant, the samurai were surrounded. A crowd of cold, otherworldly flames hovered just out of arms\u0027 reach, as if taunting. Fiendish laughter echoed in the distance, then closer... Yet a mere moment later, the flames disappeared as though nothing had ever transpired. Darkness enveloped the path once again.\nThere are few in Hingashi who have not heard tales of the bake-chochin. Though these haunting lanterns typically seek only to play tricks on those that wander too close, the ones we encountered on Mount Rokkon clearly had a mind to give chase. According to Tokimori, generations of head monks at Shojo Temple carried a lantern of identical appearance on their nightly strolls, so perhaps the bake-chochin sought merely to protect their masters\u0027 home, albeit in a unique way.\nThe lantern now in my possession bears the following words in Far Eastern calligraphy:\n\u003CItalic\u003E1\u003C/Italic\u003EIf fortune you seek\nKnow that our light glows brightest\nWithin twilight\u0027s reach\nAnd \u0027tis the kami of fire\nThis celebration entreats\n\u003CItalic\u003E0\u003C/Italic\u003EI know not precisely what this poem calls upon its reader to \u003CItalic\u003E1\u003C/Italic\u003Edo\u003CItalic\u003E0\u003C/Italic\u003E, but its words occupy my thoughts nonetheless.",

Few were as diligent at harvest time as he\u2500and none so quick to leap into action on the fateful day that screams rang across the fields. Swallowing his fear, he followed the sound to find his neighbors beset by a beast of terrible countenance, its unnatural form proving it the very man-eating monster that had terrorized the people of Shishu for moons. And so, knowing lives would be lost to even a moment\u0027s hesitation, the young man lobbed his pitchfork at the creature\u0027s exposed belly. It turned tail and ran for the cover of the mountain, howling in pain. Ever since, the village has held a yearly event dedicated to tossing their tools at bundles of straw, in a form of ritual that doubles as useful practice in the event that the kami are slow to respond to future incidents.\nImagine my surprise when, having recovered that fork of legend, I discovered the famed swordsmith Nanakusa\u0027s mark upon it. Two histories for the price of one! I suppose all artisans must pay their dues, be it in humble pitchforks or those kettles that Rowena has such a tidy monopoly on, but the contrast between this tool and Nanakusa\u0027s more whimsical works is striking. One would never guess that its maker would go on to build Shishu\u0027s most expansive smithy, guarded in each cardinal direction by statues of the Four Lords...",

    "Description": "Given their function as a spiritual bulwark against the earthquakes that plague Hingashi, stones of protection are far from unique to Mount Rokkon. One tale connected to them, however, certainly reflects its unusual history.\nLegend has it that a warrior of some renown once visited the mountain as a pilgrim. During his soul-cleansing climb up its slopes, he put his hands together to pray at a stone of protection. In that very moment, a twisted beast leapt from the shadows. It was injured, a pitchfork protruding from its belly, but regardless of circumstance, the warrior could hardly ignore its attempts to tear his head from his body. He plunged his trusty blade into the creature, which thrashed violently in response, colliding with the nearby stone. Ominous peals resounded from the earth below. In alarm, the warrior lost hold of his weapon, while the beast escaped into the foliage and out of sight. Fearing an earthquake was indeed imminent, he carefully wiped the beast\u0027s blood from the stone, and all was silent once more.\nThere are several variants of this legend: in one, the warrior slays the beast, while another insists that it was the creature\u0027s bloodcurdling cry that set the earth to rumbling. Still other tales present natural disasters themselves as divine\u2500or at least preternatural\u2500entities. All contain at least a grain of truth, for the fears of a population constantly under threat by events outside its control are very real.\nIf one theory out of the Studium is to be believed, the stones\u0027 protective power may also be more than superstition. The gist, I recall, is that stones of protection are a form of magical focus not dissimilar to nouliths, and thus can stabilize aetherial currents when placed at confluences. Alas, I remember naught of the finer details\u2500beyond their being rather dull.",

Rousing from his contemplations, he opened his eyes to see who had business of such import as to interrupt his tranquility...and came face-to-face instead with a twisted beast. If its form left any doubt to its identity, the weapons lodged in its flesh confirmed that it was Shishio, king among nue and terror to the smallfolk. Though the thought of ending a life\u2500much less that of a creature struggling, despite deep wounds, to survive\u2500was abhorrent, so too was the thought of letting this devourer of men go free. He readied his holy staff, and struck at the mononoke.\nThe battle was a fierce one, but the monk had the upper hand. To draw the conflict to a close, he struck his staff into Shishio, turning it to stone. He would go on to found Shojo Temple, that a watch might be kept over the now-silent mononoke, and its seal remain unbroken evermore\u2500or so the legends say.\nHoly staves such as the monk wielded are quite unlike those of Western mages. Not only do they hold the particular power to purge fell magicks via sound, their use as physical weapons goes far beyond unsophisticated bludgeoning. Though I sadly lack the skill to make use of such awesome power, I find myself considering more mundane applications. In climbing Mount Rokkon, even well-trained ascetics surely find themselves in need of additional support from time to time.
