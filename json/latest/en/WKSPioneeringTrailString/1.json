    "DevelopmentLogDescription": "These are the faithful records of our cosmic exploration as memorialized by myself, the humble Reportingway.\n\nOur fearless leader Searchingway's ambitious project has begun! The Moongate Hub, base of our interstellar operations, is but newly constructed, and as such our facilities are skeleton in nature, from the hangars that house our machinery (perhaps one day advanced enough to propel us into the great unknown!) to the stores which offer our workers the materials they need for their projects.\n\nIndeed, our greatest concern at present is the small meteor showers that occasionally pepper our tents on Sinus Ardorum... Quality of fabric notwithstanding, one cannot imagine achieving our goals huddled beneath such fragile infrastructure!\n\nIt will be the work of our talented friends from Etheirys that sees our plans to fruition. May these long-lived dreams prosper!"

    "DevelopmentLogDescription": "Our prayers have been answered by the steady stream of personnel from Etheirys, be they Labyrinthos experts or scholars of the Studium. Not to mention the cohort of esteemed gleaners, adventurers, and artisans─a more diverse populace I have never seen!\n\nIt is thanks to everyone's diligence that we have been able to transform our modest Moongate Hub into something more established. A Base Camp Beta, if you will. Gone are our feeble tents, replaced by sturdy metal roofing! We need not fear the occasional meteorite as once we did.\n\nWith ample talent at our disposal, we have taken our inaugural steps with no little pride or success. I wait with bated breath to witness how our endeavors unfold outside the Moongate Hub."

    "DevelopmentLogDescription": "One may think it strange that we Loporrits are now endeavoring to “explore” the moon upon which we have resided for so long. Yet the facilities we create here serve not only as a mooring point for our interstellar aspirations, but a testing site for the challenges we may face on foreign stars.\n\nIn this sense, our successful construction of the Cosmoliner may prove to be our most instrumental boon. As we cannot yet confirm the presence of stable aetheric confluences on distant stars, we must have an alternative means of transportation at our disposal. The Cosmoliner provides us with just that, and hopefully we will witness the day when it spans the entirety of Sinus Ardorum."

    "DevelopmentLogDescription": "A habitation module and cosmoport have been successfully constructed by the hands of Etheirys! The relative modesty of these facilities bespeaks the enhancements we hope to make someday.\n\nFor our habitation module, we incorporated feedback we received from Smileton in order to create an authentically safe and enjoyable environment within which to live. I repeat: you need not fear unwanted exhilaration whilst residing in this humble abode.\n\nAs for the cosmoport, it is a triumph of Sharlayan's latest technology. Apparently, there exist faint confluences of aether within space, to which the cosmoport will guide any starfaring vessel, and whilst this model is still primitive, it carries us one step further towards interstellar travel! How marvelous!"

    "DevelopmentLogDescription": "The mechs you see and use in Sinus Ardorum are the fruits of both Loporrit and Etheirys labor, painstakingly crafted to suit whatever needs lie within the vast abyss we one day shall traverse.\n\nHowever, the tents we housed our precious mechs within did little to prevent dust and detritus from jamming joints and eliciting errors. But no longer! No, our newly renovated mech hangars now prevent environmental harm to their precious cargo. I hear that even further improvements might yet be made, but for now our mech ops should proceed even smoother thanks to our latest infrastructure!"

Weddingway is our Loporrit in charge of this endeavor, and together with Sharlayan agriculturalists they have been experimenting with myriad fungi and flora. As rumor holds, fungi-enthusiast Lovingway visits quite often...which may explain why one is far more likely to find mushrooms than flowers blooming in the Bower."

Together with our Sharlayan compatriots, we developed a new type of tunneling shield that allowed us to dig our way through without incident!\n\nNow more than ever I believe that no matter what awaits us on foreign stars, we shall be able to overcome any obstacle!"

Put to the right use, these new resources will prove vital to the future of cosmic exploration, or I have not two ears and a fluffy tail!"

Better living conditions and the installation of supply stations are but a few notable improvements that will help all our workers on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, we mustn't rest upon our laurels─there is much and more we might yet accomplish for the Moongate Hub!"

After securing safe passage, we proceeded with mining and constructing this gigantic lift using the knowledge we gained from building Piercingway Tunnel. I think it safe to say that the nadir lift is more than just a triumph of technological prowess, but a symbol of all the progress we have made in Sinus Ardorum.\n\nTo wit, the lunar nadir is the final area into which we had yet to venture! Even so, our sights are set ever further─let us press onward with cosmic exploration!"

Our rainbow crystals no longer suffer the indignity of being struck by meteorites, and the atmosphere is one of both exhilaration and belonging. How one can feel so at home whilst in the midst of rigorous research may seem bizarre, yet we have realized such a space and more both in our evolved headquarters and our efforts in Sinus Ardorum.\n\nWe never could have made it thus far without the help of all our fastidious workers. This is your triumph, dear reader!"

The arduous work of transcription becomes but a trifle, and my exhaustion fades quietly into the calm.\n\nHenceforth, our efforts will be focused anew, to distant exploration! Insofar as our dreams persist and my exotablet remains charged, I will ever remain your faithful scribe. To adventures both old and new─to eternity and beyond!"
