Such status allowed him the opportunity to marry and sire a child, but his happiness would be short-lived\u2500while the Hrothgar was called away on campaign to suppress an uprising, his family perished in the now-infamous Bozja incident.\n\nA devastated Bajsaljen later deserted the Empire, fleeing his unit along with several comrades, and it was not long until their underground activities brought them into contact with the Resistance.\n\nDuring his time in the imperial army, he had not been one to dwell upon the cruelties of life. The events of the disaster, however, left him a changed man\u2500few can match the hatred and bitterness he now feels towards his former masters.\n\nYet even so, Bajsaljen strives to master his emotions, for history has taught him that anger alone will not suffice to deliver his people the freedom they desire. Instead, he focuses his energies upon the newly reformed Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades and their sacred weapons, as he leads the fight to drive the IVth Imperial Legion from his beloved homeland.",

Notoriously reticent, the little he has divulged of his past suggests his road led through many lands\u2500Thavnair to the south, Hingashi to the east, even the imperial capital of Garlemald to the north\u2500in his quest to master the arts of the arcane.\n\nHis obsession with magery began with a journey to Eorzea.

He would make his own study of the world\u0027s magicks, and bring those powers to bear against the imperial invaders.\n\nYet although Xeven succeeded in creating a unique school of spellweaving, he refrained from sharing this expertise with others.

He does not fear death. He tempts it\u2500welcomes it, even. Such fatalism stems from a prophecy pronounced upon him by a seer of unknown origin, whom he chanced across in the ruined halls of Dalmasca. Though the words spoken were foreign to his ear, Xeven was nevertheless able to divine their meaning: when the fires of revolution stained the skies of Bozja, his doom would be at hand.\n\nAnd now that the southern front is consumed by turmoil, he believes it is there that his grave awaits. He will not seek to avoid this fate, but carve a red trail through his foes as a proud blade of Gunnhildr, until such time as his inevitable demise rises up to claim him.

Its lyrics told the tale of her people\u0027s lives and bond with nature, stories of love plucked on strings and beat on drums.

To realize this dream, however, she would also need to learn the bow. The weapon doubled as an instrument in Bozjan dance, using one bow to saw on the string of another, or twanging the bowstring to keep time. But custom dictated that the bow be no mere prop. As a mark of respect for their ancestors, who were once nomadic hunters, all dancers were fully trained in its use.\n\nThus when Isolde joined the Resistance she was already an accomplished archer, her steady hand and keen eye soon earning her a place as one of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades.\n\nYet even amongst the ceaseless violence, she harbors an abiding love and respect for what the people of the land once had...and hopes they might one day have again.

While it was true the Beast King spoke brusquely, he knew each of his subordinates by name, and was well versed in their strengths and weaknesses. When battle was joined, he did not lead from the rear\u2500indeed, he was often the first to leap into the fray. \u201COnly the weak perish\u201D was his constant refrain, and the young officer saw the truth of his words as the inept and the cowardly fell in droves before the strong. \n\nLyon\u0027s strategy sent his pets to the front lines to die in place of soldiers, and, while initially bemused, Hernais came to understand the man\u0027s fondness for the beasts.

Lamenting the thought of any other Eschva women being widowed as she had been, she entreated Lyon to accept her into his ranks in her husband\u0027s place, a petition which the Beast King was all too happy to accept.

Legatus Basch van Gabranth secretly feared Dalmasca\u0027s war mages and\u2500seeking to fight fire with fire, as it were\u2500hatched a plan to form his own contingent of powerful sorcerers. To accomplish this, he set his eyes on the subjugated former Republic of Landis\u2500in particular, Mannatheihwo, the only city in the republic to boast its own company of mage-knights. Though it was common practice for the Garleans to disband the knight companies of the nations it conquered and absorb them into the imperial army, their hatred of all things magical compelled them to quash the mage-knights of Mannatheihwo entirely. Fearing for their lives, these sorcerers had fled their homes and scattered across once-proud Landis. Knowing this, Legatus Gabranth set out in search of them.\n\nOne such mage was Sartauvoir, who had taken up residence in a small farming hamlet a stone\u0027s throw from the city where he concealed his identity, posing as a local tutor and academic. Discovered and approached by the IVth, the proud mage initially rebuffed their advances, but began to take an interest in their offer upon hearing of Legatus Gabranth\u0027s vision, similar and yet fundamentally different from that of the Empire he so despised. Realizing what Sartauvoir could offer them, the IVth\u2500patiently, yet persistently\u2500reached out to him on multiple occasions, trusting the mage would have a change of heart. One day, Sartauvoir was greeted at his place of learning by a soldier unfamiliar to him. Though the soldier stood alone, was advanced in years, and carried not even a dagger in his hand, Sartauvoir knew in an instant that even his most potent incantations would be no match for this man. So it was that he exchanged words face-to-face for the first time with Basch van Gabranth, and so it was that the mage\u2500struck to his very core by the legatus\u0027s words\u2500did swear to him his undying loyalty.\n\nIn the nigh thirty years since, Sartauvoir has served the IVth well and true. Though he has honed his already-potent skills to greater heights of power under the tutelage of Sadr rem Albeleo, his pride as a mage-knight of Mannatheihwo still burns within him as fierce as the blazing infernos he wreaks upon his foes. And yet he wields his magicks not in the name of wanton destruction, but rather in the hope of realizing the long-held dream of Noah van Gabranth\u2500the same dream once held by his father...",

This she did in order to free a monoceros, a creature of great worth to her unit, at the cost of all that she had achieved in the legion, and on pain of death. Such a brazen act may seem irrational to her comrades, but to the young Miqo\u0027te, it was perhaps the most rational decision of her life.\n\nOwing to the inability of native Garleans to wield magic, the Empire seldom incorporates the use of spellcraft in their military, but when they do, as is the case with the IVth, they take a meticulously scientific approach. Employing various creatures from wild animals to voidsent as test subjects, imperial mages study the magical arts of faraway lands and adapt them for use by people who possess limited affinity with magic. As a talented summoner, Llofii was charged with this task.\n\nWith her abundant reservoir of aether and precise touch in spellcasting, Llofii was far ahead of her class at the military academy. Upon graduation, she enlisted in the IVth Imperial Legion, where she completed a grueling initiation to earn a place in the mage detachment led by Sadr rem Albeleo. Yet though initially filled with pride, she would come to be racked by disillusionment in Bozja, where she was confronted with the cruel treatment that was forced upon test subjects.\n\nOne subject placed in Llofii\u0027s care was a monoceros, a rare and majestic beast with the power to vanquish undead beings. Despite her railing conscience, she bit her lips and dutifully conducted experiment after experiment upon the wretched creature, but her blood froze in her veins when she received the parchment bearing her next instructions and read the word: \u201CVivisection.\u201D It was then that she came to a gut-wrenching realization: the spells she helps to create are born of suffering. Burning with guilt and regret, the Miqo\u0027te made her choice: she would set the monoceros\u2500and herself\u2500free.",

Two notable fruits of this project are Vigilia and Gabriel, which are designed to be controlled both physically and mentally for superior responsiveness and maneuverability. Piloting these units, however, demands a heightened state of mental sensitivity verging on telepathy, and only those soldiers who have been augmented with magitek can achieve the requisite synchronization between man and machine.\n\nWhile theoretically sound and showing promise in the laboratory, this new interface technology remains in its infancy, and being all too familiar with the fickleness of the flesh, Sicinius resolved to test it fully in Bozja in preparation for the outbreak of conflict in Dalmasca. For this he required a test subject, and the person chosen was Dabog\u2500a cruel twist given that the Hrothgar was not a soldier of the IVth but of the enemy, the Bozjan Resistance.\n\nThe death of his parents and siblings in the Bozja incident prompted Dabog to join the Resistance, and for more than a decade he fought tirelessly against his hated Empire. Even when he was taken prisoner two years ago, he never stopped fighting, and ever sought a way to flee his captors. But on one such attempt, he plummeted from the castrum wall, the long fall shattering his spine. The chirurgeon\u0027s diagnosis was grim: he would not live out the week.\n\nIn the IVth Imperial Legion, testing is only permitted upon living men when their safety is absolutely assured, and be it friend or foe, all individuals are to be treated with compassion. Thus has the legatus himself decreed. Perverting his commander\u0027s noble intent for his own ends, Sicinius reasoned that he was saving a man\u0027s life, and proceeded with his testing in secret.\n\nSo it was that Dabog was reborn a hypertuned soldier and returned to the battlefield at the helm of fearsome new warmachina. And owing to a further act of so-called compassion on Sicinius\u0027s part, he is spared the pain of having to kill his former comrades\u2500for he no longer remembers them.",

Yet where others saw chaos, Dyunbu, a stout believer in Noah van Gabranth\u0027s ideals, espied an opportunity to realize her commander\u0027s goal of establishing an independent new nation.\n\nThe Empire\u0027s seemingly inevitable disintegration had cast a pall of uncertainty over the fate of countless soldiers, and none felt greater apprehension than those who hailed from the provinces. To such weary souls separated from hearth and home, Dyunbu extolled the virtues of the cause, encouraging them to cast aside past allegiances and join her in the promised land, while making clear her vehement disapproval of those who would align themselves with the Resistance. Such unbridled zeal places her amongst van Gabranth\u0027s most loyal, and one cannot help but wonder whence arose her convictions. To find the answer, one must glimpse into her past and see the path she walked which led to her adopting the surname Potitus, common among Miqo\u0027te with imperial citizenship.\n\nOrphaned at a tender age, Dyunbu grew up on the streets of Revenia. Though citizenship was not an unusual aspiration for those of her lot, she knew none who wanted it as badly as she did. Believing education to be the key to raising herself up, she took to stealing into the local school and learning as a student in all but name. Her efforts would not be in vain, for when she was eventually placed into imperial care, her impressive ability with letters came to the attention of officials, who sent her to be formally educated at the army reserve academy.\n\nIt was there that she first encountered van Gabranth\u0027s ideology, and it resonated with her to the very core. In the years that followed, she would enlist in the IVth and become the legatus\u0027s staunchest adherent, fighting every battle and weaving every spell in the name of her dreamed-of utopia.",

Owing to an imperial initiative, she was afforded the chance to receive an education, and through hard work won a scholarship to attend the imperial capital\u0027s most prestigious institution. There, she studied in fields such as folklore and archaeology, and attained conversance in Bozjan history and culture\u2500knowledge which serves her well in her mission for the IVth.\n\nIt was none other than Misija who proposed to the Resistance the idea to reforge the blades of Gunnhildr as a means to resurrect the primal Save the Queen\u2500all in the interests of her legion, whose ends she serves absolutely. Her loyalty can be attributed to two factors, the first being rooted in the deep-seated inequality that pervades Bozjan society.\n\nSince the days of old, the ruling nobles and merchant families of Bozja have held the lion\u0027s share of the nation\u0027s wealth, a Garlean census conducted following annexation revealing that seven out of ten earned less than half the average income while one in three lived in squalor. The situation improved somewhat when Bozja became an imperial province, but homeless children remained a common sight in the major cities, and Misija\u0027s was but one of many begrimed faces among them. \n\nAs a young girl, she survived by selling what scraps she could salvage from waste heaps, but many were the days when no food passed her lips, and hunger was her constant companion. It seemed as though this harsh life must continue forever when salvation came in the form of an imperial initiative. A welfare body was established to rescue homeless children, and it proceeded to take them off the streets and place them into institutional care. Yet resources were stretched thin, and more often than not those in need were left to fend for themselves due to naught save the whim of the gods.\n\nMisija was one of the lucky ones, and she did not waste the opportunity given to her. Yet despite her many remarkable achievements, she faced discrimination from the Bozjan upper class, who continued to regard the poor as little more than vermin. Nigh daily, she was subjected to injustice and indignities, each occasion further stoking the fire of hatred she harbored for her betters.\n\nHer grievance towards her homeland did not end there. Though few are privy to this fact, Misija is descended from the last Queen Gunnhildr, and the knowledge that her noble ancestor was betrayed by her own protectors is a source of great bitterness for her.\n\nAll of this served to deprive her of any sense of allegiance for Bozja, and she would instead pledge herself to the IVth. Since the time of the previous legatus, it has been the legion\u0027s creed to welcome all regardless of such things as race, faith, gender, and birth. What counted is one\u0027s ability and loyalty, both of which Misija possesses in abundance. Given her troubled past, it is of little wonder that she would find a home in the IVth, and there is no telling how far she will go to achieve her goals.",

    "Description": "Race: Viera\nAge: 19\nBirthplace: Rabanastre, Dalmasca\n\nA new recruit to Garlond Ironworks, Lilja first awakened to her talents as an engineer while receiving an imperial education in her native Rabanastre. Her academic accomplishments won her acceptance to the prestigious Magitek Academy in the imperial capital, but ere she could relocate to commence her studies, resistance forces launched a large-scale offensive that transformed Rabanastre into a battlefield. The young Viera was forced to seek refuge in Doma, where she sustained herself by repairing machina and designing custom contraptions. Word of her uncommon expertise chanced to reach the visiting Jessie, who offered her a place at the Ironworks. Having been an admirer of the organization due to its part in the liberation effort, she accepted without a moment\u0027s hesitation.\n\nDespite her cheery and optimistic facade, Lilja was a conflicted soul. Like no few Dalmascan orphans, she was taken into imperial care and underwent schooling intended to instill a sense of allegiance to Garlemald. And while most of her peers remained fiercely loyal to their homeland, only giving their tutors lip service, Lilja could not muster up the selfsame passion. For though she could not approve of Garlean rule, it seemed to her that the alternative, a Dalmascan monarchy, would not improve the lot of the common man.\n\nFurther blurring the lines of her loyalty was the respect she came to hold for the occupying IVth Imperial Legion, which did not forcibly conscript civilians to its ranks. During a public address, its commander, Legatus van Gabranth, proclaimed that it falls to each man to use his talents to forge his own way in life. Lilja was among those present when these words were uttered, and they spoke to her more than any nation\u0027s standard ever could. Nevertheless, she could ill turn a blind eye to the many wrongs the Garleans committed against those they subjugated.\n\nAll of this served to make of Lilja a woman who opposed the Empire, yet not strongly enough to take up arms against it, the seeming contradiction giving rise to a storm of self-doubt. In joining the Ironworks, however, she was able to quell her inner turmoil by focusing on a new objective: to simply be herself, a free spirit unburdened by whatever chaos may unfold around her. Witnessing the likes of Cid and Jessie devoting themselves to their work, she recalled the words of van Gabranth\u2500and duly set about using such knowledge and skill as she possessed to the best of her ability.\n\n\u201CHm, perhaps I\u0027m overthinking it...but what if we were to\u2500\u201D\n\u201CAhem. You\u0027re \u003Ci\u003Edefinitely\u003C/i\u003E overthinking it, Lilja. Let\u0027s actually make the thing, shall we?\u201D\n\u201CYes, I suppose you\u0027re right, Jessie... Ah! There was one other idea I had...\u201D\n\u201C\\\\\u003Cgroan\u003E Liljaaa...\u201D",

Versed in the workings of machina, he is also charged with the maintenance of the airship \u003Ci\u003EIa\u0027sar\u003C/i\u003E. Despite being a fusilier by training, Bwagi struggled to master the slender swords employed by the style. He compensates for this weakness with his superior marksmanship, which sees him unerringly strike distant targets even with short-barreled weapons.\n\nAs a young Bangaa, Bwagi was scarcely a soldier blooded when he fought the Empire as part of the Dalmascan Royal Fusiliers. When the kingdom fell, his unit was incorporated into the imperial army, but he was disinclined to serve his conquerors, choosing instead to embark upon a rambling journey. While he had many a memorable moment during his wanderings, nothing is so close to his heart as his visit to the industrial city of Abdella in Garlean-occupied Landis.\n\nAs he strolled through the streets, he came upon a play being performed by a troupe of Eschvan nomads, who were known as much as a source of foreign rumors as they were for their song and dance. The play was a whimsical affair depicting the love lives of ordinary folk, but to Bwagi, who had lived his entire life under a grim pall of conflict, it was anything but ordinary. Even as he was moved by the tale, he was struck by the jovial mood of the city, which had since regained normality following its conquest. This was his first experience of peace, and it proved heady. Taken by a sudden longing, he begged to join the troupe...only to be politely rejected.\n\nSoon thereafter, Bwagi reunited with his erstwhile comrades, and together they formed a pirating crew. But he never forgot the joy he felt that day in Abdella, and took it upon himself to lighten spirits whenever possible. His japes were more often daft than droll, but he persisted and beamed inside for every grin he succeeded in drawing from his crewmates.\n\nAlas, the carefree days of reaving were not to last, for his leader, Ba\u0027Gamnan, would fall under the influence of an auracite. The stone fed upon the battle-hardened Bangaa\u0027s burning hatred for the Empire, warping him into the draconic abomination Yiazmat, and only in death was he set free. Desiring to carry on his respected brother-in-arm\u0027s legacy, Bwagi chose to lend his strength to the Resistance, and with this decision a grim determination returned to his countenance, where it will remain until such time as his homeland is free once more.",

    "Description": "Race: Au Ra\nAge: 24\nBirthplace: Sharlayan\n\nAn Archon of Sharlayan, Mikoto studied aetherology at the Studium, and earned her mark via her contributions to the field. When not conducting research, she can be seen lecturing at the academy. Through the introduction of Jessie Jaye of Garlond Ironworks, she was invited to Kugane, where she demonstrated her academic prowess in the examination of an auracite. She would subsequently be called to Gangos to shed light upon the nature of the crystal focus, an artifact of Bozja.\n\nThough possessed of a keen mind, Mikoto can occasionally be oblivious to her surrounds; when speaking on the subject of aetherology, she has a tendency to rattle off a flurry of advanced terminology to the confusion of those present. Yet by the same token, she is not easily flustered, maintaining her composure in times of danger and duress.\n\nLike the Warrior of Light, Mikoto is blessed with the Echo, her manifestation of the power allowing her to see into the future. While resembling prophetic dreams and divinations, the visions that are revealed are events that cannot be changed, and given that she cannot see them at will, nor clearly, Mikoto does not regard the ability as particularly useful.\n\nMikoto has an identical twin sister named Kagura, but aside from their appearance and thirst for knowledge, she could not be more different from her sibling. Where she is calm and measured, Kagura is headstrong and forthright. And though Kagura won her Archon\u0027s mark earlier than Mikoto, she incurred the ire of the Forum for openly criticizing their policies and was ultimately stripped of her title. She left Sharlayan in disgust, and has not been seen since.\n\nFor as long as Mikoto could remember, she and Kagura did not see eye to eye, and conversations were nonexistent between them. Upon entering the Studium, they both went about their own business and seldom saw each other, and it was not until Kagura was already gone that Mikoto learned of what had happened. Though Mikoto may have had little interest in people, preferring instead the reliable company of tomes, her complete ignorance of her sister\u0027s trials underlined their estrangement.\n\nNonetheless, Mikoto could not help but worry for her sister, and though it was no fault of her own, she felt ashamed for not having done more to aid her. Her anguish did not go unnoticed by her senior Moenbryda, who took it upon herself to reach out to her lest she do something ill advised. Taking Mikoto under her wing, she would find every opportunity to make conversation, be it about academic matters or the mundane. In time, the boisterous Roegadyn would become like to a sister she never had, someone with whom she could share her hopes and dreams and disappointments. Their relationship was the catalyst for Mikoto to harbor an interest in others as well as the world beyond the Studium\u0027s walls. Yet despite Moenbryda\u0027s encouragement, it would be some years before she worked up the courage to take to the field. Even after the two had both graduated, their friendship would continue, every anticipated reunion seeing them while away the hours in chatter.\n\nSo it was that the news of Moenbryda\u0027s death came as a terrible shock to Mikoto. Unable to accept her friend\u0027s passing, she spent days in denial. It was only when she received a missive from Urianger confirming events that the painful reality finally set in. She wept as if her heart would break, and cursed herself for having helped to create the aetheric siphon. \u003Ci\u003EHad I only known what it was for... Had I only been there...\u003C/i\u003E For long moons such thoughts tormented her. But one day, she clenched her jaw, donned her traveling garb, and set out into the field for the first time.\n\nSince that day, Mikoto has not shied from venturing forth, and gladly takes on tasks from outside groups such as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. What matters is that she strives for the benefit of others\u2500as her dear friend once did.",

Upon joining the Resistance you provided your name and personal history, and we are in the process of verifying the truth of those details. If there were any falsehoods, now is your chance to correct them.\nA. It is regretful that the incident destroyed any evidence I might provide, but I swear that the information I gave was entirely truthful.\n\nQ. Why, then, did you betray the Resistance to our enemy? Why turn traitor?\nA. \u201CTurn traitor\u201D? I was never on your side to begin with. My mission was to infiltrate your ranks.\n\nQ. You were sent to spy on us.\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. And what was your objective?\nA. I was to ensure the forging of the Resistance weapons, and the reformation of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades. Once Save the Queen was safely in the possession of the IVth Imperial Legion, the plan was to summon the \u201Ceikon\u201D and bend it to our will.\n\nQ. An elaborate scheme that ultimately ended in failure. Have you learned from your mistakes?\nA. My only mistake was to underestimate the talents of Eorzea\u0027s champion. I knew that a seer\u0027s powers were essential to delve into the memories, but never did I dream that the renowned \u201Cliberator\u201D would become so integral to the process. Or perhaps Mikoto simply felt uneasy, and sending for \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehim\u003C/If\u003E was a means to guarantee the success of our work.\n\nQ. Whichever the case, your operation is in shambles. What will the legion do now?\nA. I haven\u0027t the slightest idea. And even if I did know, why would I tell you?\n\nQ. As we have discussed many times before, you have no reason to revile the nation we seek to build. It will be a society in which every citizen is treated as an equal, where poverty and bigotry are evils of the past. And yet still you choose to work against us.\nA. Altering the course of this country will not be a simple matter of claiming its helm. Establishing new laws and enforcing your ideals will be done amidst a storm of protest.\n\nQ. Who in their right mind would oppose us?\nA. Consider the situation from my perspective. The imperials have imposed their order upon Bozja for half a century, but have all their subjects accepted their rule, as I have? Do all enjoy the same treatment? The same standing?\n\nQ. The Empire \u003Ci\u003Einvaded\u003C/i\u003E us. Even if its laws were just, we could not help but chafe beneath the yoke of its occupation. Your comparison is flawed.\nA. And I say it is two sides of the same coin. Even should you seize control and attempt to reform what you see as \u201Cevil,\u201D there will always be those who cry oppression.\n\nQ. I find that hard to believe.\nA. Then you lack imagination. Many folk are shortsighted and resistant to change. Some will prove so stubborn that you will have to kill them before they accept the new order you hope to impose. Even as you plan to kill me.\n\nQ. Your punishment is yet to be decided. A military court will deliberate your fate once the nation has been liberated.\nA. A foregone conclusion. Why even bother to discuss it further?\n\nQ. You are not beyond redemption.\nA. Do not tease me with talk of salvation. If you mean to execute me, then bring out the headsman\u0027s axe.\n\nQ. I mean to save you. We both have our convictions, but mine do not demand your death.\nA. ...You are a gentle soul. People such as you and Bajsaljen are the pure stream trickling through the mud and muck which now suffocates poor Bozja. I pray the source of your kindness never runs dry.\n\nThis document records the interrogation of covert operative Misija Votyasch, as conducted by liaison officer Apella three days after the suspect was apprehended.

    "Description": "\u201CGunnhildr\u201D is both name and title, inherited by every queen who ruled over the Bozja of old.\n\nThe last potentate to be ordained as such\u2500the last Queen Gunnhildr in history\u2500was born Nevembya Votyasch, ancient ancestor of Misija.\n\nThe bloodline of the Votyasch tribe has given rise to generation after generation of seers, and thus when a seven-year-old Nevembya showed signs of great promise, she was taken to study at the shrine. She learned to read the stars and the winds, and divined secrets in numbers; she immersed herself in prayer, spiritualism, and the performance of sacred dance. The reward for her devotions was a place amongst the twelve shrine maidens, the personal servants of Queen Gunnhildr.\n\nThis shining era came to an abrupt end, however, when the hubris of the Allagan Empire brought about the Fourth Umbral Calamity. Bozja was plunged into chaos as great earthquakes caused the land to buckle and shift, the ragged rents in the ground spewing forth plumes of flame. In a desperate bid for self-preservation, the ruling class agreed that the power of Save the Queen should be invoked, and a champion summoned forth to deliver Bozja from destruction. But Queen Gunnhildr, knowing her essence and identity would be consumed by the ritual, refused their entreaties. Thus stymied, the statesmen raised Nevembya to the throne with unprecedented haste, imbuing their \u201Cdisposable\u201D figurehead with the authority to wield the sacred blade. \n\nMeaning \u201Cpure and selfless\u201D in the old tongue, Nevembya was true to her name\u2500though unaware of the reason behind her rapid ascension, she dutifully took up the sword and poured her life energies into the weapon. In answer to her sacrifice, a mighty entity was made manifest, and Bozja\u2500and her people\u2500were saved.\n\nWhat the instigators of this miracle did not anticipate was that the humble shrine maiden would survive the rite, and return to her mundane form. In Nevembya flowed the blood of seers, and with her heritage came the power of the Echo. Though she had received no formal training in the art, she would often see visions of the past of others\u2500a talent she never questioned as aught more than her birthright. But it was this very blessing which sheltered her soul from the dominating presence of the entity, and allowed her to wield its might as she saw fit.\n\nThis revelation filled the statesmen with abject terror. They plotted to murder their young queen with Gunnhildr\u0027s sword, and struck when she was most vulnerable. Believing the act to be righteous, that none could hold such tremendous power and remain uncorrupted, the commonfolk did nothing to defend her. And even as she lay dying, watching her lifeblood seep out across the floor, Nevembya did not curse her assassins. She knew her aetherial strength was unnatural, unpredictable\u2500it had to be contained lest Bozja suffer further devastation. She would die secure in the knowledge that her people were safe. That was enough.\n\nIn that instant, a blinding light issued forth from the blade. Nevembya had, for one brief moment, wished to live just a little while longer, and as her soul slipped away from her body, both her fervent desire and a small portion of her aether were drawn into the sacred sword.\n\nThe first sight the last of Bozja\u0027s queens beheld upon her resurrection was a circle of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades. \u003Ci\u003EAm I to be slain once more, then...?\u003C/i\u003E Towering waves of rage, grief, and rancor such as she had never felt before surged within her. \u003Ci\u003EWhy!? Why must my life be forfeit!?\u003C/i\u003E Consumed by emotion, raw and unchecked, Nevembya unleashed her will. \u003Ci\u003EThey shall kneel before me in worship. I am Gunnhildr. I am queen!\u003C/i\u003E\n\nBut another Nevembya watched the scene unfold in horror, her unheard voice screaming out in protest. \u003Ci\u003EThis is wrong! This cannot be!\u003C/i\u003E Trapped within her own mind was the Nevembya from the days before she was crowned, the Nevembya who would do anything to protect her beloved Bozja. She understood that to take life, even that of the villainous, was to forge a chain of vengeance. And that chain would stretch on and on until all were strangled within its links...",

At the top of the highest slope looms a massive wall, an imposing barrier constructed of closely fitting limestone blocks and as thick as the outstretched arms of two grown Hyurs. Scarcely a quarter of the original edifice remains, however, with the scars of centuries plainly evident upon its crumbling facade.\n\nOnce beyond this encircling wall, a small settlement can be found nestled between two hills. This compound houses the illustrious martial school known as the \u201CVerdant Path.\u201D The school encompasses what was once a Bozjan shrine, the many spires of the central building marking the site where a host of holy men and women would practice their devotions. When not engaged in spiritual endeavors, it is said they tempered their bodies with physical training, a rudimentary fighting style upon which the Verdant Path was later founded.\n\nWhen the Garlean Empire invaded, adherents of the school rose up in strength to defend the city-state of Bozja. As the incursion rolled on, however, Basch van Gabranth, then legatus of the IVth Legion, came to lament the slaughter of so much promising martial talent. He promised the Verdant Path amnesty and protection, if it would but swear fealty to the Empire. The schoolmaster accepted, and by surrendering himself to the invaders\u0027 justice were his colleagues allowed to continue their instruction. \n\nOne such teaching was the technique of \u201CThree as One.\u201D It was simple in concept, yet difficult to master, requiring three disciples to synchronize their actions in order to fell opponents far too powerful to engage alone.\n\nDuring their training days, Blaz and Velibor were ever on the lookout for a third to complete their Three as One trio. Their incomparable skill, however, meant that none of their fellows could ever measure up to them in an even contest. Only one disciple refused to admit defeat, rising to her feet again and again. That student was Aggie, a girl who came to the school as an orphan, ragged and withdrawn, but now lit up the room with her infectious grin. Blaz and Velibor loved her as a little sister, and it was for this very reason they were hesitant to add her to their ranks. The day was near when Bozja would rise in rebellion, and the Verdant Path would lend its strength to the Resistance. And what sort of brother would drag his younger sibling off to war? One so bright and full of promise should be spared the horrors of such a battle, where blood would answer for blood in unrelenting conflict.\n\nYet Aggie was not to be turned from her chosen path. She earned the rank of master, and trained until she was able to claim one of every three matches she fought against the cousins. Blaz and Velibor were compelled to recognize her achievements, and at last accepted her as their third. Their decision was swayed not by Aggie\u0027s desire to fight, but by their need to protect her if she insisted she must. They swore to be her shields, come what may.\n\nAnd what twisted fate did come. They exist now only as the trinity seeker\u2500three as one, forevermore.",

All four were once members of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades, and all four now serve the queen as her unquestioning thralls.\n\nMladen the Vanished\nBefore his \u201Crecruitment\u201D as the queen\u0027s soldier, this unfortunate Hrothgar was known as Mladen the Vanished.\n\nA second-generation Bozjan refugee born and raised in Doma, Mladen learned the arts of the ninja before joining the Liberation Front. In the days which followed the retaking of Doma Castle, he crossed over to Bozja to pledge his strength to Bajsaljen, where he taught ninjutsu to his new allies and gathered intelligence on the IVth Imperial Legion. Mladen was absent from the ill-fated assault on Castrum Lacus Litore, having been part of a unit deployed to northern Bozja. But tragedy caught up to him nonetheless when he was later enthralled on the southern front.\n\nA solitary man with no living relatives, he would often quip that he could fall in battle with a light heart for there were none to mourn his passing. Perhaps, in some buried corner of his present cursed existence, that thought yet brings him comfort...\n\nAdis the Spirited\nOnce a noted member of the Resistance, Adis the Spirited now stands hollow and obedient as the queen\u0027s knight.\n\nAdis hailed from Dirbenc, a remote region of Bozja. After receiving the standard imperial education, he served in the Garlean army as a centurion until the Bozja incident drove him into the arms of the Resistance. Although a commander of men, the hot-blooded Hrothgar was infamous for charging ahead into the enemy\u0027s midst, whereby he would call out rival officers to engage in single combat. Such selfless, reckless bravery inspired his men and demoralized the foe, and no few young Bozjans sought to follow his example. His final act was to fight a rearguard action on the southern front, ensuring the escape of as many allies as possible until the queen\u0027s undeniable aether overwhelmed him at the last.\n\nWhen the survivors reached the safety of Gangos, their wails of grief echoed through the encampment. They had lost the best of them, and the entire company, their faces streaked with tears, wished they could have fallen in his stead.\n\nTugeim the Swiftram\nThe queen\u0027s warrior is the aether-corrupted form of Resistance member Tugeim the Swiftram.\n\nAs a trueborn Bozjan who could trace her lineage back to one of the old nation\u0027s ruling families, Tugeim was afforded the rights of a free citizen in imperial society\u2500a privileged position that she discarded in favor of joining the Resistance movement. Ostensibly one of the noble class despised by Misija, she herself never belittled the commonfolk through word or deed, and although her habitual reticence often led to misunderstandings, she was in truth the staunchest supporter of Bajsaljen\u0027s efforts to impose a fair and balanced social order.\n\nIn battle, this imposing Roegadyn would wade into enemy ranks like a war-goddess incarnate, swinging an axe longer than she was tall with terrifying ease. Enthralled and empowered by the queen, she can now manipulate the forces of gravity itself...\n\nRatimir the Pale\nEven before his transformation into the queen\u0027s gunner, Ratimir the Pale was feared among his enemies as a harbinger of death.\n\nA hunter who dwelled in the wilds of Bozja, Ratimir left his simple life to take up arms against the Empire when the citadel was destroyed. As he saw it, imperial hubris had led to the deaths of countless innocents, and he would not leave his countrymen unavenged. Already skilled in the use of a firearm, his was a natural progression to the role of Resistance marksman.\n\nRatimir\u0027s legend began on the night an imperial company assaulted the encampment at Gorava. The surprise onslaught threw the Resistance ranks into helpless confusion, the lack of a coherent defense elevating the offensive into outright slaughter. The survivors rallied and sought to win free of the attackers, but the net was drawn too tightly to escape. As they waited grimly for their demise, one of the advancing imperials suddenly slumped to the ground. From the stygian darkness beyond the flame-lit camp, the sound of a firearm cracked again and again, and each time it spoke, another imperial soldier fell. The death toll mounted, and it was now the aggressors\u0027 turn to feel the cold grip of panic.\n\nIf they could have pierced that inky veil, they might have spied the determined features of Ratimir as he methodically dismantled the encircling force. When morning came and the weary Resistance troops surveyed the carnage, they found thirty-six imperial corpses with bullet wounds to the head.\n\nRatimir the Pale. Ratimir, the living legend.

Those well versed in Old Bozjan will know that, just as Lacus Litore means \u201Clakeside\u201D in the language of the Empire, Igalj Kelo means \u201Cmirror of water\u201D in that ancient tongue. It is said that on clear days when the wind was still, nary a ripple would form on the lake\u0027s surface, which would reflect the bright sun and majestic blue of the skies above.\n\nIt was here the Bozjan Resistance mustered their forces in secret at Volod, until one day when they were unceremoniously rooted out by the imperial army. Knowing his men stood no chance against the Empire\u0027s might in a face-to-face conflict, Bajsaljen ordered a full retreat from the outpost, dispatching his three most trusted lieutenants to cover those in flight. Stanik, Xeven, and Isolde succeeded in uniting with the surviving troops, but were ambushed on their return by Albeleo and his regiment, who sought to take advantage of the situation by picking off the Bozjans in their weakened state.\n\nSurrounded on all sides, the three fought bravely, expertly employing the rocks, the trees\u2500even the corpses of their ill-fated countrymen as a defensive wall against their foe. In the end, however, the Garleans\u0027 sheer firepower proved too much to overcome. Knowing they faced total eradication otherwise, Stanik and Xeven entrusted their wounded men to Isolde, then engaged in a diversionary attack, which succeeded in confusing the imperials, and thus buying much-needed time for her escape. Stanik and Xeven, however, now found themselves alone and entirely at their foe\u0027s mercy\u2500it was only a matter of time before their enemy closed in and finished them off once and for all.\n\nGazing up at the moon for what they thought would be the last time, they sat together and waited for the inevitable.

Xeven, enjoying a strong drink as he was wont to do, closed his eyes and reflected back on the night he had all but known would be his last.

    "Description": "A trigger weapon forged by the fallen Allagan Empire, Save the Queen was born from painstaking study of eikons and a desire to simplify and streamline the process by which they were summoned. Such devices\u2500of which this holy blade stands as a prime example\u2500serve as the catalyst by which an eikon may be called forth.\n\nAs for how this legendary sword did come to ancient Bozja, none can say. In light of Bozja\u0027s military weakness, it is inconceivable that they could have seized or stolen it themselves, and there is little reason to believe that Allag favored the Bozjans so much to have presented it as a gift. A more likely possibility is that an Allagan apostate who no longer looked kindly on the empire defected to Bozja and gifted his new countrymen the artifact of his own accord.\n\nIn any event, the fact remains that the holy blade of Bozja, that which could be wielded only by the hand of Queen Gunnhildr, was a trigger weapon\u2500a relic of Allagan ingenuity.\n\nThe mechanism by which it is powered is a wondrous thing.\n\nIn the days of ancient Ivalice, the crystal known as auracite was worshipped as a reliquary. Come to this world from the heavens on the wings of Ultima, the High Seraph, it houses power beyond mortal comprehension\u2500a power that resonates with the desires of man, giving them concrete form. It was in their quest to artificially improve upon this natural phenomenon that the Allagans did create such a fearsome weapon, which forges the wielder\u0027s deepest desires into a trigger for calling forth an eikon. Having succeeded in the summoning, the Allagans then sought a means by which to bend said eikon to their will, and\u2500after much trial and error\u2500came to the conclusion that this could only be accomplished by one possessing the power of the Echo. The discovery was a testament to the terrifyingly boundless knowledge of the Allagans.\n\nIn time, Misija\u2500having heard tell of the blade and the tragedy of Bozja\u0027s final queen\u2500sought to manifest its primal power, with herself as conduit. Yet summoning alone would not suffice\u2500she required a means by which to retain control over her body and will throughout the process. For this, she would need the power of the Echo. So, with knowledge gained through the Empire\u0027s vast information network, she located a Sharlayan scholar by the name of Mikoto, known to possess the gift. Having succeeded in kidnapping her quarry, Misija employed techniques developed by Lord Aulus mal Asina at the Resonatorium to reproduce Mikoto\u0027s powers within herself, thus becoming Resonant.\n\nMisija then sought to use the residual aether left in the blade by its former wielder\u2500the woman born as Nevembya Votyasch\u2500and her memories to conjure the shade of Queen Gunnhildr. While these reserves were sufficient to temper the Resistance warriors who stood before her, however, they were woefully insufficient to accomplish her ultimate goal of becoming an eikon. When she learned that a fount of abundant aether such as she required could be found in the ruins of the ancient Bozjan palace Delubrum Reginae, her path was clear. There, with the power of the great crystal housed in its innermost chambers, Misija at long last made the holy blade\u0027s true power her own.\n\nSo it was that the queen stood before the Warrior of Light, with years of bitterness in her heart, that she might see Gabranth\u0027s vision made real by her own hand...",

Fearing for his son\u0027s safety, Rostik\u0027s father entrusted the child to his elderly master before departing for the front lines, from which he would never return.\n\nThough hailed as a hero by his people, the man\u0027s bravery was ultimately in vain, and once-proud Bozja fell under the imperial yoke. The young Rostik vowed that he would one day be strong enough to defend his beloved homeland, and devoted himself to training as a gunbreaker under the selfsame master who once taught his father, eventually being conscripted by the imperial army. \u003Ci\u003EI will be my nation\u0027s shield\u003C/i\u003E\u2500or so he swore to himself. Yet Rostik was doomed to suffer a fate as tragic as his father\u0027s\u2500if not more so. While he was serving the Empire, the Bozja incident occurred, and his beloved homeland was razed to nothingness.\n\nAfter the fall of the citadel, Rostik awaited his chance and fled the army. For a time, he fought like a beast thirsting for vengeance, launching reckless strikes against imperial forces from seemingly every direction. Yet there was a limit to what one gunbreaker\u2500no matter how skilled\u2500could do against an entire army. One day, Rostik was ambushed by an imperial regiment, and suffering grave wounds, was left to die alone deep in the forest.\n\nIn a turn of good fortune, before succumbing to his wounds, he was discovered by Bajsaljen, who had seen the gunbreaker fall in battle against their common foe, and took him in, tending to his injuries. Persuaded by the cerebral Resistance leader to abandon his rage-driven quest for revenge, Rostik now fights to protect his countrymen, imparting his impressive skills to a new generation of gunbreakers as a mentor to his subordinates.\n\nSo it is that the art of the gunbreaker, once in danger of extinction, came to be preserved through the years. Indeed, the high-ranking Resistance officer Marsak and Thancred, the \u201CScion\u201D who he met through a curious twist of fate, are among Rostik\u0027s countless pupils. Rostik continues his fight to this day, that he might see his techniques handed down to posterity, and his nation one day reborn.",

    "Description": "Race: Au Ra\nAge: 29\nBirthplace: Dagluk, Southern Nagxia\n\nThough born and raised in the southern reaches of Nagxia, her lineage can be traced back to Doma. Indeed, for several generations her family thrived in Nagxia making the land\u0027s culture their own, all the while dutifully upholding their Doman traditions. Unfortunately, her family line was cut woefully short twenty-six years prior, and Atori must now uphold these traditions on her own.\n\nUnder the command of the XIth Legion, the XVIIth infantry division was dispatched to invade the mountainous regions of southern Nagxia. While the Nagxian resistance lacked a comparable martial force, they were not without cunning. Rather than attack directly, they relied on their knowledge of the land, assailing the imperials via surprise raids and ambushes. The Nagxian resistance was relentless, stalking the imperials both by the light of day and in the dead of night. Thus the XVIIth infantry was deprived of rest, kept constantly on edge, and before long it was clear these tactics had taken their toll. Even so, no one could have foreseen what would befall the village of Dagluk.\n\nIt was a small village, and without the immediate aid of the resistance, the people found little recourse but to submit to the imperials\u0027 authority, offering up what little food and water they could afford to forestall uncertain death. Their uneasy peace would be broken, however, when an ale-sodden imperial soldier thought to assault a hapless villager. They tried to defend themself, but the drunken soldier escalated the altercation, and before long the villager was dead. When questioned by his superiors, the soldier claimed he was assaulted by the resistance, but the villagers knew the truth. Torches and tools in hand, they demanded the imperials leave Dagluk. But their cries of anger were answered only with gunfire.\n\nThe massacre of Dagluk\u0027s people was initially reported as the result of a bloody battle with the Nagxian resistance. But survivors from the village would give the lie to these claims, the dark truth made painfully clear when a soldier of the XVIIth infantry at last came forward, unable to bear the weight of his conscience. The unit was then recalled to the imperial capital where it was summarily dissolved. Emperor Varis was quick to denounce the infantry\u0027s actions, but the seeds of resentment had already been sown in Nagxia\u0027s bloodied soil.\n\nAtori was but an innocent child of four summers when this atrocity came to pass, whisked away to safety by her mother. Though she did not emerge from the village unscathed, Atori\u0027s mother refused to stop until she was certain of their safety. And so they traveled without food or water for three days and nights, desperate to find sanctuary. Eventually they would find it in the arms of resistance soldiers out on patrol. It was only then she allowed herself to succumb to her injuries, her final breath a sigh of relief, comforted by the thought that Atori would live.\n\nIt was believed the trauma of her loss shocked Atori into silence. In time, she would find her voice again, and attest to the horrors visited upon her village.\n\nThanks to her mother\u0027s sacrifice, Atori had gained a new family among the resistance, none offering her comfort more so than Kosyu, who she would come to look up to as a brother.\n\nWhen she was of age she joined the resistance, taking up the lance, and with Kosyu\u0027s help she quickly became one of their more accomplished fighters in the battle for freedom.",

His true name is difficult to pronounce for those not of his clan, so his comrades in the resistance have given him the nickname \u201CKosyu,\u201D which means \u201Ctiger whiskers\u201D in the more commonly used local dialect.\n\nHis thick accent paired with his habit of mumbling means he is often misunderstood, and as a result, he does not make friends easily. However, his skill with an axe is without question, and the decision to send him to the Bozjan front line was met with unanimous approval. \n\nHis experiences with the Empire began when the invasion of Nagxia reached Bunlai, his home. Kosyu was only eight years old when most of his kin were killed, and together with the other survivors, he fled the village and became a refugee. As the imperials advanced, they were forced farther and farther southward, and they were met with many hardships on their journey. Kosyu\u0027s younger sister by three summers was claimed by sickness, and he had no choice but to bury her himself. He swore on her grave that he would never shed another tear, and from that day forth, devoted himself to the resistance. \n\nAlthough he initially struggled to fit in due to his manner of speaking, it quickly became apparent to those around him that he not only excelled in the martial arts but also had an aptitude for academic pursuits. \n\nHis life would take another dramatic turn one year before Nagxia finally lost its war with the Empire. Kosyu was patrolling the jungle when he encountered a mother and daughter, emaciated from hunger and exhaustion. The woman used her dying breaths to speak of the tragedy that had befallen the village of Dagluk. Traumatized by the passing of her mother and the barbaric scenes she had witnessed, the young girl could not utter a single word. Her name was Atori, though it would be some time before Kosyu would learn this. She bore a strange resemblance to his deceased sister, and he soon found himself caring for her as though she were his own flesh and blood.\n\nEventually, the pair grew to become two of the Nagxian resistance\u0027s most valued warriors, and they fought bravely in the battle for Castrum Viride, their achievements earning the acclaim of their comrades.\n\nWhen the Eastern alliance was asked to send reinforcements to aid the Bozjan Resistance, Kosyu and Atori were quick to volunteer, and their requests were immediately accepted. Their devotion to liberating others from imperial oppression knows no bounds, and whether it be fighting for their home or for allies in distant lands, they will fight until the last.",

Though his homeland was already under the imperial yoke at the time of his birth, Oboro was raised in a secluded village where he was instructed in the art of ninjutsu by his master Gekkai. Blessed with equal measures of innate talent and dogged determination, he quickly rose through the ranks and was awarded the title of jonin, given only to the most skilled shinobi.\n\nWhen Lord Kaien led his rebellion, Oboro proudly fought at his side. After a hard-fought battle, they succeeded in taking back Doma Castle, and it seemed for a fleeting moment that Doma\u0027s liberation had been won. Victory, however, proved as ephemeral as bubbles in the sea\u2014owing in part to the machinations of a fellow shinobi who had already defected to the Empire, providing them with vital intelligence from the shadows.\n\nBefore long, Zenos\u0027s XIIth Legion was upon them, and Lord Kaien\u0027s revolt mercilessly crushed. \n\nOboro survived the battle, and upon returning home, was tasked with a new mission by the village elders\u2014he was to make for Eorzea, and pursue the traitor who had betrayed his homeland. \n\nSo it was that Oboro came to practice the art of the shinobi in a new land, ready to return at a moment\u0027s notice should his homeland require his skills. And return he did when Hien, son of Kaien, led his own revolt, playing a vital role in the infiltration of the Dairyu Moon Gates. \n\nThis time, Oboro has been summoned by Lord Hien once more, to provide invaluable support to the Bozjan Resistance as a key member of the Eastern alliance.\n\nOboro is a serious-minded youth with a strong sense of justice\u2014so serious, in fact, that he often comes off as rigid and inflexible. At the same time, he is passionate about defending others, and would sooner throw his own life away than put another\u0027s in danger\u2014an almost reckless courage that has won him no small number of admirers among his fellow shinobi.\n\nThis all-consuming devotion to his duty, however, has left Oboro less adept at dealing with interpersonal relationships and everyday affairs. Though he is of more-than-marriageable age, he appears completely at a loss as to what steps might be required to go about finding a woman to take as his bride. \n\nThe following is the sworn testimony of a shinobi who insists on anonymity, but has accompanied Oboro on multiple forays to Eorzea:\n\n\u201CThe elders have often suggested that it would be easiest if Oboro simply allowed a matchmaker to set him up with a suitable bride. As a jonin, needless to say, tradition dictates that he is bound by duty to father children and raise them to be great shinobi in their own right\u2014a duty which Oboro has no intention of neglecting. And yet, it would seem that his exposure to Eorzean customs and lifestyles has colored his thinking somewhat, and recently he has expressed feeling a certain yearning to experience romantic love. You did not hear this from me, of course, but I have even seen him toting around a book on how to woo the fairer sex\u2014whether he acquired it of his own devices or received it as a gift from a certain roguish acquaintance of his, I cannot say with certainty...\u201D",

These attributes, along with her knack for infiltration, previously saw her assigned on a mission to Eorzea, where she served as Oboro\u0027s right hand in his quest to track down and apprehend a traitorous shinobi. In the selfsame capacity, she has now come to the Bozjan front, and lends her covert expertise to the Resistance effort.\n\nContrary to appearances, Tsubame\u0027s relationship with Oboro is purely one of subordinate and superior. And while not overtly instructed to do so, she tacitly understands that her duty also includes acting as a chaperone to the shinobi master, who, despite his redoubtable combat skills, has ever struggled when it comes to infiltration.\n\nShinobi are often required to adopt new identities for moons at a time in order to gather intelligence; be it on foreign soil, they are trained to seamlessly insert themselves into new environments with no more than a few days\u0027 preparation. Yet while Oboro passed all of his other shinobi\u0027s trials with flying colors, in this facet of his art alone, he was borderline.\n\nThe reason for this, Tsubame well knew: Oboro is good-natured to the core.

When he sees those in trouble, he would invariably go to their aid, and in so doing betray carefully cultivated personas.

This joint mission was headed by Meryall of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades. With calmness and composure well beyond her years, she led the operation to a rousing success. And it was because of this mission that she is the only of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades who escaped the influence of Queen Gunnhildr.\n\nBefore joining the Resistance, hers was a life not unlike many of her compatriots. Her parents died in the Bozja incident, and thereafter she was provided for through the Empire\u0027s welfare system, receiving a standard imperial education. From the first, her marks were far and above those of her peers, and it was not long before she found herself transferred into a special program for promising young military cadets. It became clear, then, she was born for the battlefield, excelling not only in martial prowess, but tactical planning as well. Mock battles often found her the victor, even when matched with the most seasoned of her seniors.\n\nIndeed, she was a student of seemingly unlimited potential, and it was thanks to the red mage Lovro that she would find a focus for her energies. The blending of white and black magic was practically second nature to her, and as her mentor, Lovro would see her aptitude for the art of red magic flourish.\n\nMeryall learned a great deal under her instructor\u0027s tutelage, and when he believed her ready, he eventually taught her the truth of how Bozja was being stripped of its resources. How the Empire robbed the people of their freedom. The revelation reawakened a longing for home she had long since forgotten.\n\nHer opportunity to return would come shortly after Lovro was accused of spying on behalf of the Bozjan Resistance.

He later became a spy for the Bozjan Resistance while continuing to act as a member of the Garlean forces.\n\nLovro is trained as a red mage, and the tale of how he came to possess such abilities is somewhat unusual. When he took part in the imperial invasion of Ala Mhigo, one of the citizens who defected to the Empire was able to wield red magic. As Garleans generally lack the ability to control aether, it was decided that Lovro would be taught these techniques.\n\nLovro had an aptitude for red magic and enthusiastically absorbed all the knowledge he could. His teacher was a man named Lambard, a former member of the Ala Mhigan revolutionaries known as the Crimson Duelists, who were responsible for reviving the lost art of red magic. He offered to share the secrets of this rare form of magic with his new imperial masters as a sign of his loyalty. \n\nLovro despised Lambard\u0027s obsequious scraping and bowing to the Garleans, but he was resolved not to let his distaste show, and instead focused his efforts on mastering the Ala Mhigan\u0027s methods. Once his training was complete, he returned to the Far East, where he took on students of his own at academies in various imperial territories. However, his plan was to only teach red magic to those who bore strong feelings of animosity towards the Empire, that they may one day rise up and overthrow their oppressors. There were also students whose imperial education had made them trusting of their Garlean overlords, but Lovro sought to reverse their indoctrination without raising suspicion, all the while biding his time. \n\nLovro discovered an especially promising student upon his return to Bozja Citadel. Her name was Meryall, and despite only having fourteen summers to her name, she already demonstrated a gift for strategy, and it seemed she would make a valuable addition to the Resistance. Recognizing her vast potential, Lovro committed himself to her training as never before. Like droplets of water on an arid desert, his every teaching was absorbed almost instantaneously. \n\nWhen the time finally came, the master and student joined the Bozjan Resistance, as they had sworn in secret. Their talents earned them a place amongst the select few inducted into Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not to last. Lovro fell under the spell of Save the Queen, losing all sense of himself and forced to serve as a tempered minion.",

Upon learning of the fall of Castrum Lacus Litore, Llofii surrendered herself to the Bozjan Resistance\u2014partly out of an odd sense of gratitude to her former foes for the mercy they had shown her on the battlefield, but even more so because she realized that she and her beastly companion had nowhere else to turn.\n\nLlofii offered her captors a proposition: she would reveal to them every last bit of knowledge she possessed about the IVth Legion. In return, she asked only that her animal friend be returned to its far-off mountain to live out its life in peace. As for herself, she would accept any sentence\u2014even death. Moved by the girl\u0027s earnest plea and grim determination, Bajsaljen took her in\u2014not as a prisoner of war, but as one of the Resistance\u0027s own. \u201CHelp us win our freedom,\u201D he offered, \u201Cand you may see your friend safely home yourself.\u201D\n\nLlofii accepted these terms willingly, for in truth, she had unfinished business on the battlefield. She could not rest easy until she had freed all the other miserable beasts left trapped at the IVth Legion\u0027s research facility and personally ended the life of its overseer, Fabineau the Heedless\u2014for only in doing so would his cruel and twisted experiments be brought to a merciful end. \u201CWill you fight with me, my friend?\u201D Llofii spoke gently to her imposing companion. \u201CIf it is not too much to ask of you, that is.\u201D\n\nBajsaljen swore a vow to the girl that no matter what became of her, he would see her beloved beast returned to its rightful home when the battle was won. Llofii thanked him, then pondered for a moment whether or not\u2014in leading the monoceros into the fray\u2014she was no better than Fabineau himself. Suddenly feeling great shame, she patted the beast gently on the nose and tried to set off for the battlefield alone...only to find the monoceros following dutifully behind her. Though the creature no doubt cared little who emerged victorious in wars fought by men, it did know one thing\u2014it wanted to stand beside and protect the only person in this world that had shown it kindness and mercy.",

Utterly devoid of empathy, he considers the lives of men and beasts alike to be worthless, and delights in tormenting those around him without the slightest twinge upon his conscience. Results are everything to this monster who speaks like a gentleman, and all else is but a means to an end. Egotistical in the extreme, he holds himself in the highest regard and unerringly believes himself right.\n\nYet self-absorbed as he is, there is one individual who is capable of breaking through that shell to rankle him: Sicinius mal Vellutus. A native of Garlemald, Sicinius is an academic elite who served as a researcher under Aulus mal Asina at the Resonatorium. When Ala Mhigo fell to the rebels, he was given the choice to return to his homeland, but opted instead to transfer to the IVth Legion, where he won the favor of the legatus and was made senior engineer. With his peerless talents and thirst for discovery, he ushered in numerous advances in magitek, his successes cementing his authority in the IVth such that none dared to challenge his use of men as test subjects in contravention to the legion\u0027s creed.\n\nThough Fabineau\u0027s pride will not allow him to admit it, deep down he regards Sicinius as his foremost rival. And it is his desire not to be outdone by the latter that pushed him to immerse himself ever more in his magical research. This led him to conduct tests on arcane entities and beasts such as the monoceros with ever-escalating barbarity.\n\nWhen questioned on his methods, he is noted to have responded thus: \u201CThe lives of men are precious, and unlike certain individuals, I can rightly say I\u0027ve not endangered even one. Yet if we truly desire to end this war and secure lasting peace, we must have power.

    "Description": "Race: Hyur (Far Eastern)\nAge: 41\nBirthplace: Godo Village, Doma\n\nThe Urabe clan was once a well-respected house of Doma, and fervent practitioners of Onmyodo. Charged with the oversight of the nation\u0027s religious affairs, they served at the pleasure of Doma\u0027s royal family for generations. Under the Empire\u0027s rule, however, any and all religious exercises were strictly forbidden, the Garleans believing they would invariably lead to the summoning of eikons. All known to be onmyoji, practitioners of this spiritual art, were kept under close watch. The viceroy Yotsuyu\u0027s treatment of these people was said to be especially cruel, bordering on the inhumane\u2500a true test of faith, some would attest.\n\nWhen the opportunity arose, a great many of the onmyoji fled from Doma, some choosing to go underground and form a resistance group. The Urabe family could not abandon their pride, nor could they shake their sense of duty to the royal family. And so they chose to stand and fight\u2500a valiant-but-fruitless endeavor that would prove the end of that once-noble house.\n\nAt least, that is what the Empire was led to believe. In truth, a small number of the Urabe clan\u2500led by Yamatsumi\u2500would escape, assisted by none other than Noah van Gabranth. Thus would the Onmyoji Brotherhood rise from the ashes of the Urabe clan.\n\nWhere the Empire abhorred the onmyoji\u2500often based on misguided principles\u2500Gabranth saw untapped potential, which is why he offered Yamatsumi a place at his side. The Doman fugitive was understandably apprehensive until he came to learn of Gabranth\u0027s goals to not only reclaim Doma from the Empire, but ultimately build a prosperous new nation in Dalmasca. Gabranth was not at all the cruel, callous imperial Yamatsumi presumed him to be, and his earnestness proved enough for the onmyoji to pledge his services to the IVth Legion.\n\nHaving been handpicked by Gabranth himself, one might expect Yamatsumi to hold high station within the IVth Legion, but his position among the rank-and-file soldiers would lend him the freedom needed to better fulfill Gabranth\u0027s plans. Menenius took advantage of this state of affairs, tasking Yamatsumi and his cadre of mages with seeking out certain holy relics.\n\nThe onmyoji possessed a penchant for finding such artifacts, it would seem, for after he fled Doma, a holy artifact\u2500the kami-no-iwato\u2500was discovered in his possession. It is uncertain how this votive jewel found its way into his hands, but Yamatsumi claims it was originally bequeathed to the royal line of Doma by his forebears, and he merely claimed what was rightfully his. Doman officials, meanwhile, refute such claims, and have charged him with the crimes of larceny and treason.",

    "Name": "Pagaga quo Vochstein",
    "Description": "Race: Lalafell\nAge: 20\nBirthplace: Neimrahava, Dalmasca\n\nThe house of Vochstein is known in Ala Mhigo for producing many skilled beastmasters. They specialize in the breeding and training of griffins, and those they have raised were much beloved by members of the royal family. As griffins offer their riders an unrivaled degree of mobility and are stalwart allies on the battlefield, they had a central role in Ala Mhigo\u0027s beastmaster battalion. In light of their achievements in the raising of griffins, the Vochsteins were made members of the nobility, and though their status paled in comparison with more established houses, they served the nation diligently.\n\nSo loyal were they to the royal family, that when Garlemald invaded Ala Mhigo, Cairm, the head of the Vochsteins, chose to let free the griffins he and his kin had raised rather than allow them to fall into the hands of the imperials. It is a tragic tale still told by the people of Ala Mhigo to this day. \n\nOnce the nation had succumbed to Garlean rule, the Vochsteins vehemently refused to serve the Empire, stating that the griffins of Gyr Abania must only be used for the good of Ala Mhigo and her people and should never become tools of the oppressors. The XIIth Legion would have executed Cairm were it not for one of his sons, Ganpp, requesting to join the imperial army. He was known for his wild temperament and uncontrollable nature, but he was also the most gifted beastmaster of all of Cairm\u0027s sons. In exchange for Ganpp joining the XIIth Legion and sharing with them his family\u0027s methods of griffin training, Cairm was released. \n\nThe fact that his family\u0027s name was in tatters and he was branded a traitor was of little concern to Ganpp, and he threw himself into the work of raising griffins. However, his coarse and haughty demeanor made him extremely unpopular among the XIIth Legion. Eventually, stories of the rambunctious newcomer reached Legatus Gabranth of the IVth Legion, who took Ganpp off of their hands in order to bolster his own battalion of beastmasters. \n\nBeing transferred to a new legion did naught to curb Ganpp\u0027s insolence, until he finally met his match. During a mock battle in which the IVth Legion\u0027s beastmasters were pitted against each other, Ganpp was clearly outclassed by Lyon, the Beast King. Not one to take such defeats lying down, Ganpp later challenged Lyon to various contests, all of which he subsequently lost. He became despondent and sullen, which only served to widen the rift between him and his fellow soldiers. \n\nA pivotal moment came when troops of the IVth Legion had driven a group of Dalmascan rebels into the Neimrahava Woods. His commanding officer gave the order to set fire to the forest, but Ganpp refused, claiming that it would lead to the deaths of countless woodland creatures. These words fell on deaf ears, and when his fellow imperials set about lighting fires, he separated from the rest of his battalion and raced into the forest. His griffin discovered a helpless young Lalafellin girl who appeared to be one of the inhabitants, and though Ganpp normally had little interest in other people, he heeded the griffin\u0027s cries and rescued her from the blaze. \n\nIt soon became clear that she had been left to fend for herself in the wild, and she was utterly unable to communicate, let alone read or write. Ganpp named her Pagaga and decided to care for her as though she were his own. Although she did all she could to turn him away and refuse his affection, the look in her eyes told him all she wanted was to be loved. Perhaps she reminded Ganpp of himself. \n\nUpon returning to the legion, Ganpp was charged with disobeying orders and absence without leave. Though this was enough to have him executed, Lyon recognized Ganpp\u0027s potential and requested a more lenient sentence. He was instead punished by flogging, and after being thrashed to within an ilm of his life, he was sent back to the stables. For three days and three nights he battled with a raging fever, and he may have died were it not for the kind ministrations he received from none other than Pagaga.\n\nHaving survived his ordeal, Ganpp was a changed man. Any vestiges of his abrasive and repugnant former self had vanished, and he now treated others with kindness and respect. While some members of the legion thought his flogging had finally beaten some sense into him, Lyon was sure that it was Pagaga\u0027s devotion that helped Ganpp to see the good in people. During their time working alongside one another, Lyon and Ganpp brought great renown to the IVth Legion\u0027s beastmaster battalion.\n\nIt was not destined to last, however, as Ganpp\u0027s fighting days were cut short by an incurable illness. As he lay bedridden, he formally accepted Pagaga as his foster child, that she may bear the Vochstein name in his stead. As he breathed his last, she vowed to build upon her father\u0027s legacy by becoming the greatest beastmaster of them all, and one day surpass Lyon himself.",

By all accounts, the Seeq is a generous captain who regularly treats his minions to meat\u2500a practice for cultivating loyalty he retained from his days at the head of his own mercenary company. Going back further still, Daguza was once a robber-knight. In the plainest terms, this refers to a knight who engages in robbery, but the status of knighthood accords a certain dubious privilege: the ability to challenge others to duels, which Daguza used as a pretext to divest people of their belongings.\n\nThe scion of a poor-but-noble family, Daguza inherited his knighthood and became the master of his household. Rather than tending to the affairs of his estate, however, he preferred to while away the days drinking and gambling with friends. When his coffers were inevitably spent, he took to robbing merchants who passed through his domain, but ere long his reputation came to precede him and that well of ill-gotten gains ran dry.\n\nIt was then, just as Daguza had resigned himself to a mundane and less lucrative calling, that Garlemald launched its invasion of Dalmasca. Sensing an opportunity, the Seeq formed a mercenary company and sold its services to his own kingdom, though he harbored no sense of allegiance towards it. And so, when the initial contract ended, he scandalously offered to fight for whichever side was willing to pay more. \u201CI\u0027m just trying to feed my family,\u201D he declared in justification\u2500said family being the rogues he called his brothers. Yet even as both armies were unimpressed with his unprincipled display, they recognized it was wiser to keep his potentially troublesome band out of the enemy\u0027s camp, and thus did the Seeq continue to be gainfully employed.\n\nFollowing Dalmasca\u0027s annexation, Daguza kept up the selfsame antics, selling his company\u0027s services to the highest bidder. And as fearsome as he was in battle, he never shied from turning tail when the tide turned against him, remaining ever true to his motto: \u201CYour life is worth more than your name.\u201D As a result, his company members boasted a high survival rate, which, combined with their reasonable successes, brought them a steady stream of work. However, with Emperor Varis\u0027s ascension came a tightening of standards surrounding the use of mercenaries, and Daguza suddenly found himself without a contract.\n\nStruggling to feed his company, Daguza was on the verge of disbanding it when salvation arrived in the form of Legatus Noah van Gabranth, whose IVth Legion had more than its fair share of troublemakers. If he could bring order to this unruly lot, he was told, he would be rewarded with rank and riches. He accepted the offer without hesitation and was made a soldier of the legion, yet in his heart of hearts his priority remained unchanged: looking after his own. So long as they have food to fill their bellies, it matters not under whose banner he fights. No, his allegiance is to no nation or army\u2500but never let it be said that he doesn\u0027t give his employers their coin\u0027s worth.",

Though a brilliant student, his overweening manner won him few friends, and he took instead to the company of tomes, channeling his keen mind towards the study of forbidden magicks. In the course of his research, he acquired a copy of the Scriptures of Germonique, the sacred texts of the outlawed sect of the selfsame name. Curiosity piqued, he sought out the remnants of the sect, who initiated the willing youth into their arcane secrets.\n\nIn the olden days of the Kingdom of Dalmasca, the vast majority of the populace were adherents of the Church of Iocus, the state religion tracing its origins to Saint Ajora. Other faiths were tolerated, this being an acknowledgement of the diverse nature of the nation\u0027s peoples, yet the members of the Sect of Germonique alone were branded heretics, and were exiled if not executed. Wherefore were these individuals the subject of such brutal oppression? At the heart of it lies the sect\u0027s contradiction of church doctrine.\n\nWhereas the church held that Germonique is the betrayer who slew Saint Ajora, the sect considered him the true savior. And whereas the church taught that Ultima, the High Seraph, is a servant of god, it believed that Ultima herself \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E god, from whom comes the gift of auracite\u2500miraculous stones with the power to solve all of mankind\u0027s woes. Yet far from aiding mankind, these relics wrought disaster wheresoever they appeared and were regarded with fear by other citizens. This fear manifested as violence towards the sect, which fought back by committing indiscriminate acts of destruction across the kingdom.\n\nSo it was that the Sect of Germonique was designated an extremist cult. Its leaders were put to death, while those followers who refused to renounce their faith were banished. Yet beyond the borders of Dalmasca, the sect found a way to survive. And one day it welcomed a man named Gilbrisbert into the fold. Using an auracite fragment as a bargaining chip, Gilbrisbert enlisted in the IVth Legion, where, in exchange for the sect\u0027s preservation, he struck a deal to form a unit wielding the relic\u0027s power: the Zealots.\n\nMembers of the sect believe that, by sacrificing their lives, they will be taken unto heaven to join Ultima. Thus do they willingly offer up their flesh in a ritual that transforms them into the demonic Lucavi in battle\u2500a ritual made possible by the power of the auracite fragment. Gilbrisbert is all too happy to assist his Zealots in this endeavor, and not only does he transform them; he also brings them under his control. For this twisted predilection, he has earned the reviled epithet of the puppetmaster, although it appears he has embraced it as a badge of honor.",

However, there were two key obstacles to their weaponization.\n\nFirstly, there was the matter of preparing a suitable host. The strength of the voidsent one may summon is largely dictated by the vessel it will occupy. The entity that might inhabit the corpse of a coeurl, for example, would be several orders of magnitude weaker than one inhabiting the corpse of a behemoth.\n\nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly, was the unpredictable nature of voidsent and their need to feast on aether. A binding spell could be cast at the time of their summoning to subjugate them, but the efficacy of these incantations drops significantly when employed against the higher echelons of voidsent.\n\nIn short, the Allagans required immeasurably powerful hosts and an equally potent means of binding these creatures to their will. Neither could be obtained through natural means, and so, as one might expect, the Allagans turned to science for solutions.\n\nIn the end, they chose to use genetically augmented components to create what they believed to be the perfect host, paired with the restraints used to imprison Meracydian dragons.\n\nThe weapon discovered in Zadnor was in all likelihood an interim vessel for Diabolos, a demonic voidsent believed to occupy the second rung of the voidal hierarchy. It would not be easily summoned, much less bound, and so researchers speculate it could not have been encountered until after Emperor Xande formed the pact which opened a gateway to the World of Darkness. Moreover, it is quite possible the ancient Allags intended to unleash this chimerical monstrosity upon the fledgling nation of Bozja to test its capabilities.\n\nThough we but glimpsed its power, it appears the Allagans succeeded in creating a formidable addition to their arsenal, perhaps even comparable to the Ultima Weapon. It remains to be seen if more such weapons lie buried beneath the plateaus of Zadnor.",

    "Name": "Cid Garlond",
    "Description": "Race: Garlean\nAge: 34\nBirthplace: Garlemald, Garlean Empire\n\nHead of Garlond Ironworks, Cid is the firstborn son of former chief imperial engineer Midas nan Garlond. Following in his distinguished father\u0027s footsteps, the young Garlond embarked upon the path of science, which saw him attend the prestigious Magitek Academy and graduate with highest honors. When his father passed, he was nominated to replace him as chief engineer, but disillusioned with the Empire\u0027s use of technology for conquest, he made the decision to defect to Eorzea. In his adopted homeland, Cid came together with like-minded individuals to found the Ironworks, through which he provides technological support to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and their allies across the realm and beyond.\n\nAs a child, Cid revered his father and wanted nothing more than to emulate his brilliance, but cracks formed in their relationship when Midas became consumed with his work and began neglecting his family. Any hope that they might reconcile was dashed when the Meteor project, the senior Garlond\u0027s obsession, ended in catastrophic failure, resulting in the annihilation of Bozja Citadel and much of the surrounding city. Caught amidst the destruction, Midas was grievously wounded and passed away in despair shortly thereafter.\n\nWhen the news reached him, Cid blamed himself. He and his father had spoken only the evening before the tragedy, and he could not help but feel he could have prevented it. In that last meeting, Cid had succeeded only in reaffirming the gulf between them. Had he persisted, perhaps he could have made his father see reason. But he did not, and chose instead to cut the encounter short and returned to the imperial capital. At the last, he admonished himself, it was not his father who had forsaken him, but him who had forsaken his father.\n\nFor fifteen years, the memory tormented Cid, a thorn in his breast that could not be extracted. But in the course of assisting the Bozjan Resistance, he came to learn the shocking truth of that fateful day. Through the power of the crystal focus to explore memories, it was revealed that the elder primal Bahamut, entrapped within the red moon Dalamud, had exploited Midas\u0027s lunar transmitter to take the engineer in his thrall. Subsequently, Midas advanced the Meteor project at a breakneck pace and ultimately brought about the citadel\u0027s destruction\u2500all according to the fell being\u0027s design.\n\nIn revisiting that encounter with what he had come to know of tempering, Cid recognized the signs. His younger self, however, did not, and the trauma of having his father attempt to gun him down was such that he had subconsciously suppressed the event, replacing it with a false recollection. But now he accepts the memories, and takes comfort in remembering his father as the warm and caring man he once was\u2500the selfsame man who smiles at him from the family portrait in his locket, which he found the courage to open again after fifteen long years.",

    "Name": "Fran Eruyt",
    "Description": "Race: Viera\nAge: Unknown\nBirthplace: Unknown\n\nThough Fran seldom discusses her background, from her remarkable leadership and proficiency as both a tactician and warrior, it is presumed the general of Lente\u0027s Tears has many years of experience and most likely an age to match.\n\nShe is also believed to be a former member of the Dalmascan peacekeeping forces, which if true, further supports this theory. The organization was primarily charged with protecting the royal family and the capital of Rabanastre, with their jurisdiction limited to the confines of the city. Even among such a specialized group, Fran was assigned to a unit that dealt with organized crime and the most hardened offenders.\n\nFran and her comrades were known as the Saraab and their operation was completely separate from the rest of the peacekeepers. While the organization as a whole was established specifically to protect the royal family and the capital, the Saraab\u0027s activities included maintaining public safety and order throughout the kingdom. Were a threat to the realm to arise, the Saraab had the authority to take any measures necessary, even if said threat involved members of the nobility or the royal family itself. \n\nAs such, the Saraab worked in complete isolation, with the identity of its members only known to those belonging to the unit. It is for this reason that even towards the end of the war with Garlemald, members of the royal fusiliers such as Ba\u0027Gamnan and Bwagi never came into contact with Fran.\n\nFran led one particular group within the Saraab whose duties included protecting designated persons from the shadows, pursuing suspected rebels and cult members, and preventing attempted espionage by foreign nations.\n\nThe final task assigned to Fran\u0027s group was the \u201Cassassination\u201D of Princess Ashelia. In truth, it was a secret mission to fake the princess\u0027s death and have her live on in secret, thus protecting the royal bloodline. The plan was a success, with Ba\u0027Gamnan and several other fusiliers witnessing the staged assassination, and unwittingly fulfilling their role of spreading the false news of her death. Even the ones who handled the princess\u0027s supposed corpse were Fran\u0027s subordinates. The mission was carried out under the permission of Princess Ashelia\u0027s twin brother Prince Rasler, who knew that defeat to the Empire would mean the execution of the entire royal family. Were the people of Dalmasca allowed to know that Ashelia was still alive, they would be incensed to fight the Garleans to the last man, despite there being no hope of victory. Rather than watch his people die in vain, he devised a means of spiriting her away, even going so far as to keep his plan a secret from his father, the king. The princess was put into a deep sleep using a method passed down among Fran\u0027s kin until the day arrived for the kingdom to be reborn. \n\nWhen Ashelia finally awoke some thirty years later, many of her memories had abandoned her, but she could still remember her identity and purpose. However, whether it was a result of her induced slumber or because of the emotional scars left by the horrors of war, she would often find herself assailed by images of the past. In the years that had passed, Fran had become a general of Lente\u0027s Tears, and she continued in this role while also acting as advisor to Ashelia.\n\nDuring the events surrounding the mystical auracite, Fran encountered the selfsame former royal fusiliers who had, unbeknownst to them, cooperated in faking the princess\u0027s death. To compound Fran\u0027s feelings of guilt, their leader Ba\u0027Gamnan had undergone a hideous transformation and was subsequently killed, denying her the opportunity to make amends with him.\n\nAlthough thirty years had passed since Ba\u0027Gamnan was deceived into believing the princess to have been killed, Fran could not escape the feeling that had she revealed the truth to him, the terrible fate that befell him could have been averted.\n\nAnother of the royal fusiliers, Ba\u0027Gamnan\u0027s brother Bwagi, eventually became a loyal friend to Fran. While he and his comrades are not aware that Ashelia is in fact the princess herself, they believe her to be a descendant of the royal bloodline. It remains to be seen whether their feelings of joy will be unchanged upon hearing the truth, but when the time finally comes for Fran to explain the events of that fateful day, she is prepared to face the consequences of her actions. \n\nHowever, that time has yet to arrive. Now that Bozja has shaken off the yoke of imperial rule, the resistance cannot afford to let the opportunity to liberate Dalmasca escape them. Until then, Fran will continue to wear the mask of deception and keep the truth hidden from her allies.",

    "Name": "Hien Rijin",
    "Description": "Race: Hyur (Far Eastern)\nAge: 24\nBirthplace: Doma\n\nThe renowned warrior-king of Doma\u2014eldest son of the former king, Kaien, and his wife Mina\u2014Lord Hien was conceived just before the imperial invasion of his homeland. By the time the infant gave his first cry, Doma was under the imperial yoke, and so did Hien grow up under the Garlean occupation. Allowed to learn traditional Doman culture and martial arts under the condition that he also received a proper imperial education, the young child immersed himself in his studies under his tutor Gosetsu, a loyal vassal of his father\u2014mastering the swordsmanship of a samurai and developing a strong identity of himself as a man of Doma.\n\nWhen still young, Hien took part in an armed uprising led by his father, an attempt that nearly succeeded in taking back Doma Castle until it was unceremoniously quashed by the XIIth Legion, summoned to the scene as reinforcements. In the struggle, Lord Kaien was tragically cut down by Zenos yae Galvus. Bereft of his beloved father, Hien fled desperately for his life to the vastness of the Azim Steppe.\n\nOver time, Lord Hien would come to join forces with a hero come from distant Eorzea to the west. Together with loyal subjects Gosetsu and Yugiri, and with the unwavering support of his people, the Domans, Lord Hien would succeed in toppling the occupying Garlean army commanded by acting viceroy Yotsuyu, achieving independence for his homeland anew.\n\nPainfully aware of the difficulty of resisting the might of Garlemald as a lone, isolated nation, Lord Hien entered into an agreement with the Eorzean Alliance, while simultaneously enlisting the aid of such independent-minded entities as the nomads of the Azim Steppe and the pirates of the Ruby Sea. Together with the forces of Nagxia and Dalmasca, recruited to the cause some time after, these would form the Eastern alliance that would stand against the Empire across the continent of Othard.\n\nBefore commencing their own large-scale rebellion, the leaders of the Bozjan Resistance paid a visit to Lord Hien, receiving from him a promise to offer military support as necessary, as well as inspiration for a method by which the internal conflict within the Resistance itself might be mediated\u2014to wit, by the reforging and re-forming of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades.\n\nFor Lord Hien\u0027s part, though he was heartened that his Eorzean friend had also promised to join the battle on the Resistance\u0027s behalf, lingering doubts remained. The Garleans were an invading force, yes, but were they not also men driven by their own sense of justice? A war waged between two mighty forces, the leaders of each believing their own cause the righteous one, would no doubt prove a bitter struggle, and one that would not end without considerable tragedy and suffering on both sides.\n\nWhen he heard that, in fact, the new incarnation of Gunnhildr\u0027s Blades had been reborn into a tempered monstrosity, only to perish in the end, Lord Hien was deeply troubled. What was the meaning of his presence on such a nightmarish battlefield? A true hero should be a beacon of light to all, akin to the kami who illuminate the heavens. Yet all he could accomplish here was to lead the victor over the vanquished\u2014leaving his hands stained with the blood of the fallen at battle\u0027s end.\n\nAnd yet Hien understood that this, too, was a role that someone must fulfill\u2014if not, a people would suffer indeterminately under a rule of tyranny. And so he would put an end to it, even if it meant bloodying his own hands. Better that he accept this now, than force a similar fate upon the next generation when they grew to adulthood.\n\nIf this conflict could be resolved without bloodshed, he would give anything to see it done\u2014but sadly, that was not an option now, and mayhap had never been at all. No doubt his Eorzean friend, too, realized this\u2014and no doubt it weighed equally as heavily on both their hearts.\n\n\u003Ci\u003EMy friend, if you would bloody your hands for this cause, then pray let me bloody mine with you. After all, it is no greater or less an evil than that which I once asked of you. Until the day when all the peoples of our world can live in peace, let us walk this path together...\u003C/i\u003E",

    "Name": "Noah van Gabranth",
    "Description": "Race: Hyur\nAge: 48\nBirthplace: Arnsbeirgs, Landis\n\nLegatus of the IVth Imperial Legion, Noah van Gabranth assumed his position ere he had reached twenty summers when his father, Basch van Gabranth, succumbed to a deadly illness. He spent much of the three decades since ensuring that Dalmasca and Bozja remained under the imperial yoke, marching his men across the region to quell rebellions and revolts in territories controlled by the IVth.\n\nThe IVth is oft regarded as anomalous and eccentric among the Empire\u0027s legions, and with good reason\u2014for it is the only one to count a greater number of foreigners than native-born Garleans among its ranks. This includes the legatus himself, who has made it his policy to accept any and all capable individuals into his company. So long as the individual in question swears loyalty to the Empire, the IVth welcomes their contributions, regardless of race, gender, or country of origin. Ability and results delivered are valued above all\u2014a true meritocracy. Gabranth applied a similar philosophy to the provinces under his rule, eschewing the traditional Garlean approach and tailoring his style of governance to suit the people of each individual region. Emperor Solus found this most admirable, though it is said Emperor Varis was far more skeptical\u2014believing it a sign that Gabranth harbored lofty and dangerous aspirations ill befitting his station.\n\nA charismatic figure beloved by almost all in command, Gabranth\u0027s fate took a dark turn after his defeat in Bozja, his once-vaunted legion left struggling to fend off the combined counterattack of the Dalmascan resistance and Eastern alliance. Depleted and run ragged after multiple battles with the resistance army\u2014and with no reinforcements from his homeland coming to save him\u2014morale dropped to an all-time low, and the IVth stood in danger of losing a vital outpost.\n\nIt was then that events took another unexpected turn, as the Beast King Lyon\u2014taking extreme umbrage at being held responsible for the IVth\u0027s defeat\u2014plotted mutiny against the selfsame leader to whom he once swore undying loyalty. Escaping his gaol cell with the help of his co-conspirators, he snuck into the chamber where Gabranth lay wounded in the dead of night. After an exchange of words between the two men, it was clear the legatus\u0027s mind was made up\u2014he succumbed to his subordinate\u0027s blade with no resistance. The deed done, Lyon set Castrum Valnaini ablaze and fled the scene to destinations unknown. Later, the body and armor of the ill-fated Gabranth would be discovered by the resistance, though he was not immediately identified as such\u2014in part because the burns were so severe that his face could scarcely be recognized, and in part because so few had seen the face under the mask in the first place. Still, in the end, the identity of the corpse was confirmed, and news of the death of Noah van Gabranth spread across the land.\n\nBereft of their charismatic leader, the once-proud IVth Legion quickly crumbled, some two-thirds of its numbers surrendering unconditionally to the resistance, while the remaining third fought in vain before being unceremoniously decimated by their foe. So did the long and bitter struggle come to an end, and Dalmasca shook free from the imperial yoke for the first time in over three decades.\n\nAnd yet still, there are those who believe that Noah van Gabranth did not perish that day in Castrum Valnaini\u2014that the corpse, mutilated beyond identification, belonged to another. Meanwhile, Lyon and the other former officers of the IVth\u2014war criminals, all of them\u2014remain at large, and the provisional government approved the repatriation of the vast majority of the IVth\u0027s rank-and-file soldiers as free citizens, electing not to try them for their crimes on the battlefield.\n\nSo it is that the people of Dalmasca still live in fear of the \u201Cghost of Gabranth\u201D\u2014further details regarding which will be filed in a future report.",
