I did learn, however, of a cautionary tale told to their young\u2500that to enter the valley comes at the risk of great, swelling pain from sabotenders\u0027 needles.\nA pain I quite acutely feel at this very moment!"

From the architecture, I daresay they are of Yok Huy make.\n\nFor those who built Zorgor the Boundless, constructing edifices of such magnitude is a feat well within their capabilities. On the other hand, the subtle design of the engravings on the structure and the ingenuity of the aqueduct are unlike anything I have seen in Urqopacha.\nPerhaps these discrepancies can be attributed to cultural differences with the Yok Huy who came to these lands."

It is all I can do to scribble down these notes while evading their relentless assault!\n\nAs I labor to breathe, a thought occurs to me: they could be mammets created for the purposes of mining resources... Yet, the most logical explanation for their aggression would be that they are a defensive mechanism left behind by the Yok Huy.\nThough my guards appear similarly fatigued, we can hardly retire now\u2500not when the promise of a great new discovery lies just before us!"

Yet our king believes that there is no greater evil than to hinder the potential of man, and so he has ordered us to make this conception a reality. He would bolster our military might and break through into the outside world. If our research will further this ambition, then perhaps it is worth pursuing."

    "Unknown0": "Our bodies are fragile vessels. Although the infusion of another person\u0027s soul confers strength and vitality, the soul of a beast yields mixed results. Even when stripped of memories, a feral soul can induce psychological instability in the subject. I suspect this is because primal instincts remain. And while a certain amount of bestial ferocity is expected\u2500and I daresay, welcomed\u2500too many such souls can lead to physical mutations. For now, our objective shall be to determine the threshold beyond which a body is at risk of uncontrolled mutation."

    "Unknown0": "The rate of transfiguration may be dictated by the potency of the soul consumed. We\u0027ve experimented with fiends of great power, but mutations were observed after the infusion of merely a single soul. No better was this phenomenon illustrated than with poor Atticus. His body was altered irreparably, and he lost all capacity for rational thought. While the primary objective of this research was to utilize the soul of a tural vidraal, I struggle to see a path forward. An alternative approach must be considered."

By purging a beast of its memories and infusing it with a man\u0027s soul\u2500one still possessed of its own memories\u2500we stand to gain absolute control over a vessel of great power. My subordinate, who first proposed this brilliant hypothesis, shall have the honor of being the first to transcend our meager limits. I must prepare his soul for extraction at once!"
