    "Unknown0": "Though publicly known as the organization\u0027s receptionist, Tataru also serves as the Scions\u0027 coinkeeper\u2500a role she executes with an enthusiastic cunning that borders on the terrifying.\n\nBorn to Ul\u0027dahn merchants, the young Tataru had everything a Lalafell could ask for\u2500until her family lost it all to bankruptcy. Plagued by debt and still smarting from this abrupt introduction to the harsh realities of the sultanate, she apprenticed herself to a lapidary at the age of twelve, and henceforth supported the household with her meager earnings. It was during this period that she met Minfilia\u2500a miner come to sell gems and ore\u2500who would later recruit Tataru to oversee the Path of the Twelve\u0027s finances.\n\nTataru, in turn, resolved to use her newfound position not only to accrue personal wealth, but also to serve others. Indeed, when the Path of the Twelve relocated to the Waking Sands, and her role was expanded to include secretarial duties, she used her considerable social acumen to build relationships and increase its influence. As the organization slowly but surely grew into an association of like-minded and gifted souls, she was instrumental in seeking out potential members blessed with the Echo.\n\nAfter the Seventh Umbral Calamity, when the Path of the Twelve merged with the Circle of Knowing to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, Tataru continued her tenure as secretary and coinkeeper combined. When the political situation in Ul\u0027dah drove the Scions from their headquarters for a time, she journeyed with Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to Ishgard, that they might there regroup and rebuild the organization. Later, she accompanied a contingent of Scions to the Far East, where she established ties with the East Aldenard Trading Company\u0027s Kugane branch in order to fund local anti-imperial resistance efforts\u2500one of her many laudable ventures on the Scions\u0027 behalf.\n\nPrivately, Tataru has long regretted her inability to assist her comrades in martial endeavors, and thus sought to train as an arcanist. Alas, these efforts met with misfortune, including the escape of her Carbuncle companion, and so she has since resolved to provide financial support through trades such as mining and weaving. In so doing, she has become something of a master artisan\u2500going so far as to establish her own boutique in Old Sharlayan\u2500yet she always manages to find the time to fashion new outfits for her Scion friends when they stand poised upon the threshold of journeys new."

    "Unknown0": "This secret society was the product of a merger between the Circle of Knowing, led by Louisoix Leveilleur, and the Path of the Twelve, led by Minfilia Warde, following the Seventh Umbral Calamity.\n\nWorking in concert with the leaders of Eorzea, the Scions strove to address the myriad problems that plagued the realm, be it the godlike primals, the imperialistic Garleans, or the scheming Ascians\u2500beings who have long shaped history from the shadows. As a means to achieve its objectives, the society sought out those blessed with the Echo, a mysterious power with myriad manifestations, the most notable of which was the ability to walk in the memories of others. It was for this reason they extended an invitation to the Warrior of Light.\n\nOn account of their contributions in dealing with several primals and the XIVth Imperial Legion, the Scions\u0027 existence became public knowledge. Utilizing their newfound reputation, Alphinaud Leveilleur founded the Crystal Braves, a military organization intended to pave the way for a unified Eorzea. However, the society\u0027s activities had made it the target of a Monetarist faction of Ul\u0027dah, and an elaborate betrayal by Alphinaud\u0027s presumed allies resulted in the Scions being framed for the sultana\u0027s assassination. Though branded fugitives and scattered for a time, they eventually learned of a plot within a plot that saw the monarch put into a deep slumber rather than slain, and succeeded in clearing their names.\n\nTheir honor restored, the Scions went on to become key players in the liberation of Ala Mhigo and Doma from imperial rule, and after helping to avert the Final Days, they judged their mission fulfilled. So it was that they announced their disbandment\u2500at least outwardly\u2500and retreated from plain sight to labor in secret once more."

One day, however, following a keening sound from the land, their magicks ran rampant, giving form to eldritch horrors born of fear and despair. Their blissful lives became a waking nightmare, and mankind was driven to the brink of extinction.\n\nThe Convocation of Fourteen, the people\u0027s chosen representatives, observed that the phenomenon manifested where the celestial currents, the star\u0027s outermost flow of aether, had grown weak and stagnant. In order to address this deficiency, they summoned forth the mighty Zodiark to exert control over the laws of creation. Though this act demanded a high price\u2500the sacrifice of half of mankind\u0027s remaining number\u2500the vast majority willingly rendered up their lives, and thus were the Final Days forestalled.\n\nOver the intervening millennia, this star-encompassing calamity had faded from memory. But faced with its second coming as engineered by the Telophoroi, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn embarked upon a desperate quest for the truth. At length, they discovered that an ancient named Hermes had created Meteion, a being capable of traversing the great expanse, to ascertain the meaning of life by seeking out other civilizations in the universe. Alas, Meteion and her sisters found naught but despair, driving them to conclude life was suffering and death the sole mercy. Fleeing to the edge of existence, they became the Endsinger, and proceeded to unleash the power of dynamis, an esoteric energy set in motion by feelings, to usher all stars to their doom, that life need not continue in vain.\n\nDespite seemingly insurmountable odds, the Scions held fast to hope, and amidst darkest despair lit the way for their champion as they confronted the Endsinger at her nest. And at the end of a fierce battle, they emerged triumphant, and put an end to the Final Days once and for all."

    "Unknown0": "One of Ishgard\u0027s most capable knights, Estinien\u2500called \u201CWyrmblood\u201D by many\u2500once led his order as the renowned Azure Dragoon.\n\nEstinien\u0027s origins are humble, having been born to a family of sheepherders in the eastern highlands of Coerthas. However, the course of his pastoral life was forever changed when his village of Ferndale was razed by the great wyrm Nidhogg\u2500an attack which claimed the lives of his parents and his brother.\n\nBereft of home and family, the orphan of twelve summers was taken in by Alberic, then holder of the title of Azure Dragoon. The two proceeded to forge a complicated relationship. A martial instructor, an adoptive father, and a flawed knight\u2500one who failed to protect his family. To the young Estinien, Alberic was all these things and more.\n\nWhen his training was complete, Estinien joined the Temple Knights. So focused was he on the fight against the Dravanian Horde that he scarcely remembered the names of his companions. His sole friendship was with Aymeric de Borel, a knight of similar age who shared Estinien\u0027s passion for the cause. Estinien\u0027s prowess saw him rise through the ranks, first becoming a dragoon, and later inheriting the title of Azure Dragoon once held by his foster father.\n\nLike all Azure Dragoons, Estinien would carry with him the Eye of Nidhogg\u2500a relic torn from the wyrm\u0027s head over a thousand years ago. Though the Eye conferred power to the bearer, it rendered them vulnerable to Nidhogg\u0027s influence, and his undying hatred threatened to consume Estinien\u0027s very soul. Only through constant vigilance and strength of will did Estinien maintain a grip on his sanity\u2500though there were occasions when he came perilously close to succumbing to Nidhogg\u0027s rancor.\n\nIn the midst of the Dragonsong War, Estinien offered to accompany the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud Leveilleur in their quest to convince the Dravanians to renounce their thousand-year campaign of vengeance. Though he did not believe they would succeed, Estinien nevertheless agreed to eschew violence\u2500unless circumstances forced his hand. They were later joined by Ysayle, leader of the heretics, who similarly believed peace an unlikely prospect, but one still worth pursuing in earnest.\n\nEstinien traveled with the others to the Churning Mists, where they sought an audience with Hraesvelgr, brother of Nidhogg. From the great wyrm they learned the truth of the Dragonsong War: that it was King Thordan of ancient Ishgard who drew first blood when he and his knights murdered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, and subsequently devoured her eyes so that they might claim her power for themselves. Yet in spite of this truth, the fact remained that Nidhogg was intent upon the destruction of Ishgard, and if he could not be persuaded to yield, they had but one recourse. In the end, the Azure Dragoon succeeded in hunting down and slaying his archenemy, presumably ending the thousand-year war.\n\nUpon their return to the capital, Estinien and his companions discovered that Archbishop Thordan VII had plotted to wield the power of a primal to transform himself into an eternal god-king and bless the world with his twisted idea of harmony. They pursued the archbishop to Azys Lla, where they put an end to his machinations once and for all. However, in the wake of the battle, Estinien succumbed to the all-consuming hatred within Nidhogg\u0027s two eyes, transforming into a vessel for the wyrm\u0027s shade that would marshal his forces for a final assault on Ishgard. Following his defeat on the Steps of Faith, Estinien regained partial control and urged Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to kill him, but instead the two tore the eyes from his body, casting out Nidhogg\u0027s shade and saving the dragoon\u0027s life.\n\nWith his homeland entering an age of peace, Estinien renounced his title of Azure Dragoon and set off on a journey of his own. Even during these wanderings, though, he stayed abreast of the Scions\u0027 activities, and participated in both the liberation of Ala Mhigo and sabotage efforts within Garlemald. In time, he gave in to the relentless solicitations of Tataru and Krile, officially becoming a Scion and working tirelessly with his comrades to deliver the world from the calamity known as the Final Days.\n\nFollowing his long journey from archnemesis of dragons to their friend and brother, Estinien renamed his lance Nidhogg after his fallen foe. Though he is still a lone wolf at heart, he travels more often with others than before\u2500such as to the isle of Thavnair, where he has forged a new friendship with Vrtra, another of the first brood."

    "Unknown0": "A relatively recent addition to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, G\u0027raha Tia hails from Corvos in southern Ilsabard, where the Allagan Empire once flourished during the Third Astral Era. Although the Miqo\u0027te were once forced to toil in obscurity for the glory of Allag, G\u0027raha Tia\u0027s tribe, ever proud, devoted themselves to the study and preservation of arcane secrets. Thousands of years later, when Corvos was conquered by the Garleans and brought under the jurisdiction of the illustrious House Darnus, a young G\u0027raha\u2500heir to vast stores of Allagan knowledge and the last child born with the Allagan Eye, was given into the custody of the Students of Baldesion.\n\nAfter acquiring Sharlayan citizenship and freedom from more mundane duties, G\u0027raha concentrated on his education, earning his Archon\u0027s mark for his groundbreaking research into ancient arcane wisdom. Owing to these qualifications, G\u0027raha Tia was tasked with the vital duty of investigating the Crystal Tower, the most fascinating and forbidding of the surviving relics of the Allagan Empire. It was during this expedition that he met with Rammbroes of the Sons of Saint Coinach, Cid Garlond of the Ironworks, and the Warrior of Light\u2500an occasion which led to the formation of the fellowship known as NOAH.\n\nWith his newfound companions, he laid bare the secrets of ancient Allag, and learned from the awakened clones Unei and Doga that the eye he inherited was, in truth, the Royal Eye, the unmistakable mark of the Allagan imperial family. With it, he could control the Crystal Tower itself, per the wishes of Salina, the final princess of Allag, who had chosen to pass down this gift and place her trust in future generations.\n\nJudging that mankind was not yet ready for the secrets of the Crystal Tower, G\u0027raha Tia sealed himself within it, in the hope that he might awaken in an age when his fellow man had set aside their differences\u2500when they might truly comprehend and wield the Allagan knowledge for the benefit of all.\n\nAlas, when G\u0027raha awoke from his slumber two hundred years later, the world had been ravaged by tragedy and death, for the Eighth Umbral Calamity had come to pass. Biggs\u2500third of his name and eighteenth chairman of Garlond Ironworks\u2500had cracked the tower\u0027s wards, seeking to harness the power within to develop a means of time travel, that they might forge a future in which the Calamity had never occurred. G\u0027raha agreed to lend them his aid, and so it was that he and the Crystal Tower were transported into the past\u2500not of their world, the Source, but of the reflection known as the First, where fate would once again see him reunited with the Warrior of Light.\n\nThe First, for its part, had suffered a calamity no less daunting than that of the Source. A Flood of Light had nearly extinguished all life, and what little remained was beset by horrors born of the phenomenon known as sin eaters. Unaged due to his symbiosis with the Crystal Tower, an ever-youthful G\u0027raha Tia took the initiative in building the Crystarium\u2500a city and bulwark of hope where he and his growing community would stand against these foes.\n\nFor a hundred years, the Crystal Exarch\u2500as G\u0027raha Tia had come to be known\u2500laid the groundwork for the coming battle, for he had always known that he could not triumph without the Warrior of Light. When the time came, he summoned the champion and their allies\u2500albeit accidentally\u2500from the Source, assembling a formidable alliance to take up arms against the Lightwardens and reclaim the long-absent night sky.\n\nThe final step in G\u0027raha Tia\u0027s plan would have seen him render up his own life for the preservation of the First and the Source. Blessedly, this sacrifice did not come to pass. Ultimately, the Warrior of Light and their brave companions succeeded in laying low the Ascians Emet-Selch and Elidibus, ending the threat of an Eighth Umbral Calamity and giving the First hope for a brighter tomorrow.\n\nWhen the Scions at last returned to their own world, they did not do so alone. G\u0027raha Tia had conceived a method in which his memories and essence in the First could be merged with his past self still sleeping within the Crystal Tower of the Source. The awoken G\u0027raha Tia eagerly joined the ranks of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and proceeded to employ his ample knowledge of all things Allagan, as well as the leadership skills he honed as the Crystal Exarch, to provide invaluable guidance and support to his companions. In particular, his decisive actions in Thavnair during the Final Days ensured the survival of countless innocents.\n\nAfter the de facto disbanding of the Scions, G\u0027raha Tia joined Krile in helping to rebuild the Students of Baldesion. However, he has not yet shaken his wanderlust, and will not hesitate to seize any opportunity to embark upon a new journey with the Warrior of Light."

Uncommonly sensitive to the feelings of others, unwelcome thoughts flooded her mind, leading her to develop a guarded personality that many found off-putting. Seeing this, Galuf gave her a cat-eared hood, assuring her that her gift was not something to be bemoaned, and that it would one day prove a tremendous strength. Moved by her grandfather\u0027s words, Krile vowed to devote herself to her studies, that she might use her power to serve the greater good.\n\nDisplaying a remarkable aptitude in the mystic arts, Krile attended the Studium in Sharlayan, joining the Faculty of the Arcane and becoming highly skilled in healing and curing magicks. It was at this time that she made the acquaintance of Alphinaud and Alisaie Leveilleur, with whom she maintains a close friendship to this day. After graduation, she joined her grandfather\u0027s research organization, eventually coming to Eorzea to support the Scions of the Seventh Dawn as they rebuilt their operation following the bloody banquet in Ul\u0027dah. She lent her impressive knowledge of the arcane to the search for the missing Minfilia.\n\nKrile chose to remain in Eorzea for the foreseeable future, both out of a desire to support her friends, and for lack of a home to which she might return. Prior to her arrival, the Isle of Val was obliterated by a devastating spell akin to Ultima. While she herself was on the isle at the time, she was saved by the blessing of Light, and so she naturally fell in with the Scions. She soon became a full-fledged member, and thenceforth used her command of the Echo to serve her comrades on many an occasion.\n\nKrile suffered a particularly harrowing experience when she was captured as a prisoner of war by the Garleans during the campaign to liberate Ala Mhigo. Her Echo made her a target, as the magitek engineer Aulus mal Asina sought to study the phenomenon and create an artificial variant. He succeeded in this endeavor, transforming Fordola rem Lupis and Zenos yae Galvus into beings he dubbed the Resonant. Krile was later rescued by the Scions, and after recovering from the ordeal resolved to repay the favor. Indeed, when her companions were forcefully summoned to the First and left in a comatose state, Krile took the lead in nursing the Scions back to health.\n\nWith the appearance of the Telophoroi and the looming threat of the Final Days, Krile returned to Sharlayan in hopes of gauging the true intentions of their governing body, the Forum, which to that point had stubbornly refused to approve any aid to Eorzea. Subsequently, she would use her influence as representative of the Students of Baldesion to arrange for her friends to visit Old Sharlayan.\n\nNow that the Final Days have been averted and the Scions ostensibly disbanded, Krile has devoted herself to the restoration of the Students, recruiting the precious few survivors she has found, along with new talent, that together they might carry on her late grandfather\u0027s legacy and preserve their knowledge for future generations."

Resentful of having to mind a child instead of pursuing her own research, the revered Archon was a stern taskmaster, imposing upon her new student one harsh trial after the next. Y\u0027shtola, for her part, did not shirk from these formidable tasks, eventually winning the approval of her mentor\u2014who doubtless saw in the stubborn Miqo\u0027te girl shades of her own self as a child. After ten years of training, Y\u0027shtola emerged from Matoya\u0027s cave a woman grown, possessed of vast knowledge and skill in the arcane that easily earned her the title of Archon.\n\nStriking out on her own, Y\u0027shtola joined the Circle of Knowing, led by her mentor\u0027s colleague and friend Louisoix Leveilleur. Sailing to Eorzea, she assisted her friends in their efforts in Limsa Lominsa in the fateful days leading up to the Seventh Umbral Calamity. During that time, she won the trust of Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, to whom she lent invaluable assistance in rebuilding the Eorzean Alliance, which had theretofore devolved into a shell of its former glory. After Louisoix gave his life on the fields of Carteneau, Y\u0027shtola became one of the founding members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, formed by the merger of her own Circle of Knowing with a like-minded organization, the Path of the Twelve.\n\nTogether with her new companions, she worked tirelessly to quell the threat of the primals and defend Eorzea from the invasion of Garlemald\u0027s XIVth Imperial Legion. When the Scions were caught up in the political coup in Ul\u0027dah, it was Y\u0027shtola\u0027s command of forbidden and ancient teleportation magicks that allowed her and Thancred to escape the clutches of the villainous Crystal Braves. Left to wander the Lifestream as a result of this, she was on the verge of being lost forever to the aetheric currents when she was rescued and called back to this world through the efforts of Kan-E-Senna and the Warrior of Light. Y\u0027shtola awoke from her coma to find she had lost the physical ability of sight, gaining in its stead the power to see aether in the environment around her. This gift is a double-edged sword, however\u2014for while it allows her to remain a formidable presence in battle, the strain it places on her mind and energies is often great.\n\nHaving recovered her strength, Y\u0027shtola joined her fellow Scions in their exploits across Eorzea, traveling to Azys Lla to depose the mad Archbishop Thordan VII and bring the Dragonsong War to an end, then playing a key role in the liberation of Ala Mhigo.\n\nY\u0027shtola once again suffered a harrowing experience when her soul was accidentally forcefully summoned to the First by the Crystal Exarch. Assuming the alias \u201CMatoya\u201D in honor of her mentor and concealing her true identity, she befriended the Night\u0027s Blessed, a group of Dark-worshipers who made their home in the depths of the Rak\u0027tika Greatwood. It was around this time that Y\u0027shtola came to make extensive use of destructive magicks to complement the healing and curing arts at which she had always excelled.\n\nAfter the Scions succeeded in restoring the darkness to the Light-blighted First, they returned home to the Source, where Y\u0027shtola would again play an invaluable role in averting the dark designs of the Telophoroi\u2014in the end journeying with her friends to Ultima Thule to deliver their world from the Final Days.\n\nHaving long served the now-disbanded Scions with her boundless knowledge and puissant sorcery, Y\u0027shtola now strives to find an answer to the universe\u0027s most fundamental question\u2014seeking the truth of creation to honor the legacy of her mentor, Master Matoya."

The nature of this power was not wholly understood, and it was often conflated with another of Her gifts, the \u201Cblessing of Light,\u201D which ensured one\u0027s aether would remain uncorrupted by primal tempering. The chosen few also spoke of being summoned to the heart of the star where, according to their testaments, awaited a pure and towering crystal. It is likely that said testaments gave rise to the appellation \u201CMothercrystal,\u201D as well as the usage of \u201CHydaelyn\u201D to refer to the star itself, though the precise point at which these terms became commonplace remains unknown. While many sought further knowledge of Her nature\u2500the Sharlayan Forum foremost among them\u2500few ascertained Hydaelyn\u0027s true identity: a primal with an ancient, Venat, at Her core.\n\nIn a time before time, society was governed by the Convocation of Fourteen, upon which Venat held the seat of Azem. An indefatigable and insatiably curious individual, she tired of the academic approach to natural studies, and resolved instead to travel the star and seek its truths through firsthand experience\u2500a journey that she continued even after she abdicated her position. One day, during a visit to Elpis, she chanced to meet with the Warrior of Light, who had come from the future with a warning of calamities to come. Thus did she learn of the Final Days that would befall Etheirys, and of this tragedy\u0027s ultimate cause: Meteion, bearer of myriad fallen worlds\u0027 despair.\n\nTo prevent the obliteration of all life, Venat embarked upon a quest that would span millennia. Offering up her own flesh and soul, she summoned and became Hydaelyn. She sundered Her people, who yearned for a past that could never be restored; the god Zodiark, manifestation of that ill-fated wish; and the star itself, which She loved so dearly, into fourteen pieces. The god of Darkness was gaoled within the sundered worlds\u0027 moons, and their people condemned to a fragile and imperfect existence forevermore. However, She knew that from their imperfection\u2500their suffering\u2500would arise the strength to face deepest despair.\n\nSo passionate was Her love for mankind, so unwavering Her faith in its potential, that Hydaelyn would never, in the eons that followed, waver in Her belief. Even as shard after shard fell to calamity and were rejoined with the Source, empowering Zodiark as it enervated Her in turn, She stayed the course, awaiting the day when man would prove himself worthy. When at last the time came, and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn triumphed over Her in a battle that burned through Her very soul, She faded away with a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.\n\nThough the Warrior of Light and their comrades would go on to follow the path She had shown them, Hydaelyn was no more. Her love for Her children, however, is eternal."

Being reflections, the geographical features of these worlds are naturally similar, akin to observing the original through a looking glass. But over the course of millennia, the peoples of each have lived disparate lives and histories, and some variance has manifested in the environment itself as well.

One theory posits that the worlds exist within pockets of reality that are arranged in a pattern not unlike the numbers on a clockface, and that it is easier to travel to an adjacent reflection."

Through advances in this miraculous field, he expanded his dominion to encompass the continents of Aldenard, Ilsabard, and Othard.\n\nHowever, generations of peace and prosperity gave rise to decadence, and a thousand years after the nation\u0027s birth, progress all but ground to a halt. The people grew complacent, abandoning learning and drowning themselves in leisure, and society stagnated. None lamented this deplorable state of affairs more than a technologist named Amon.\n\nDesiring to restore his nation to its former glory, Amon brought Emperor Xande back from the grave. Under the founding father\u0027s leadership, the empire was given renewed purpose in world domination. In order to bolster the might of his armies, Xande entered into a pact with the Cloud of Darkness, a sovereign among voidsent, and granted their kind passage to the world of men in return for their aid in assuring the supremacy of his reign.\n\nThe Crystal Tower played a key role in all of these events. Built to harness the power of the sun, it provided the sprawling empire with energy during its heyday. When the empire fell into decline, Amon used that selfsame energy to resurrect Xande, and Xande in turn used it to open a gate to the void.\n\nEventually, the emperor resolved to welcome the Cloud of Darkness herself into our world, a feat which would require a voidgate of heretofore unseen proportions. To this end, he commanded that the eikon Bahamut, captured in Meracydia, be encapsulated within a massive iron sphere. The sphere was launched into the heavens and set into motion alongside the moon, where it utilized the wyrm\u0027s affinity to fire-aspected aether to accumulate solar energy in a more concentrated form. Yet while the tower had been fortified to channel the increased flow, the land upon which it had been built could not withstand the immense forces. The Crystal Tower\u0027s collapse triggered a series of earthquakes which shook the entire realm, bringing about the Fourth Umbral Calamity and consigning the Allagan Empire to oblivion.\n\nFor five millennia the Crystal Tower lay buried and forgotten, until the violence of the Seventh Umbral Era coaxed it from its resting place. Awakened from his long slumber, Emperor Xande once more sought to fulfill his nihilistic ambitions, but he would be thwarted by the stout souls of the fellowship of NOAH and their newfound comrades from the distant past."

    "Unknown0": "An avid reader since he was old enough to hold a tome, Urianger spent his youth engrossed in books of prophecy. Eastern, Western, modern, historical\u2500the young Elezen devoured all manner of sources concerning his favorite subject, though in so doing acquired an erudite vocabulary and poetic mannerisms that alienated his peers. His steadfast studiousness\u2500along with the encouragement of his childhood friend, Moenbryda\u2500did, however, enable him to enter the Studium under the auspices of the foremost authority on prophecy, Archon Louisoix. Indeed, it is thought that Urianger elected to join the Circle of Knowing to learn the truth of Mezaya Thousand Eyes\u0027s \u003Ci\u003EDivine Chronicles\u003C/i\u003E, a work that hinted at the coming of the Seventh Umbral Calamity.\n\nIn the moons preceding said Calamity, Urianger sought to share his knowledge with the people of Eorzea, but his doomsaying only served to earn him an unflattering reputation. After the prophecies came to pass, and his beloved mentor was lost in the fires of Carteneau, he and the other remnants of the Circle of Knowing joined with the Path of the Twelve to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Thenceforth, Urianger became a fixture in the halls of the Waking Sands.\n\nAlthough his profound knowledge of history has ever been a boon to the Scions, Urianger\u0027s verbose explanations and dry manner have given rise to interpersonal tensions. Of particular note are the events following Moenbryda\u0027s death during the confrontation with the Ascian Nabriales, when a grieving and guilt-stricken Urianger took it upon himself to treat with Elidibus in secret. In so doing, he learned long-lost secrets, which he used to sabotage the Ascian\u0027s plot to manipulate the Warriors of Darkness. While he had the best of intentions, the decisions he made without the input of his allies\u2500such as orchestrating the journey of Minfilia, the Word of the Mother, to the First\u2500and their consequences would long weigh heavy on his heart.\n\nTo compound his turmoil, Urianger was pressured into deceiving his allies once more when the Crystal Exarch summoned him to the First. After divulging his true identity as G\u0027raha Tia, the Exarch implored him to pretend that his own knowledge of future tragedies was a vision Urianger had witnessed when passing between worlds. Believing this fiction was essential for the success of the Exarch\u0027s plan to prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity through his personal sacrifice, Urianger reluctantly agreed and retreated to Il Mheg. However, when the truth was finally laid bare, the Warrior of Light\u2500then the Warrior of Darkness\u2500refused to allow the Exarch to trade his life for the star\u0027s safety, rendering the deception meaningless.\n\nUrianger, overcome with regret, resolved to be more forthright and emotionally open with his comrades from that day forward. Upon returning to the Source and being confronted with the reality of the Final Days, he played a key role in facilitating cooperation between the people of Etheirys and the moon-dwelling Loporrits. But it was not until a tearful reunion with Moenbryda\u0027s parents, who welcomed him as they would a son, that he began to feel as though he was growing into the man he wanted to be. Ultimately, it was the relationships Urianger cultivated that would see the ship \u003Ci\u003ERagnarok\u003C/i\u003E take to the stars, and hope restored to the star."

The Matanga came next to the isle, but they knew well enough to let sleeping dragons lie. They were followed by the Au Ra, who despite cultural differences maintained cordial relations with their new neighbors. It was not until the coming of Hyuran colonizers that Thavnair knew war\u2500and it was Vrtra who emerged to quell it ere its flames consumed the land. The various tribes welcomed his intervention, yet he remained convinced that however grateful they may be, they would never be content to let a dragon lord over them\u2500and there would never be lasting peace. And so he asked Alzadaal of the Au Ra to lead the people in public as Vrtra himself withdrew into the shadows...whence he would provide guidance to the satrap and his successors. Thus was the isle united under the banner of Radz-at-Han.\n\nAs Alzadaal and his descendants ruled the diverse Radz-at-Han for centuries, behind the scenes, Vrtra was no less devoted to her people. In fact, he was closer to them than they knew, for he oft embedded one of his eyes in alchemical simulacra of men that he might walk among them. Many of these simulacra would be sent abroad as representatives of the satrap at one point or another, there to be made permanent ambassadors\u2500providing a convenient excuse for the wyrm to switch vessels.\n\nWhen the Final Days came to his beloved home, twisting his people into beasts for whom death was a mercy, Vrtra realized that things could not continue as before. Loyal Ahewann, the erstwhile satrap, had fallen protecting the citizens, and to honor his final wish, Vrtra would have to become satrap in name as well as deed. With a little encouragement from Estinien, he at last revealed himself to the Hannish people as their longtime protector.\n\nIn the wake of an apocalypse averted, Thavnair began to rebuild under Vrtra\u0027s auspices. His simulacrum is frequently spotted out and about in Radz-at-Han, and while the public is no longer fooled by his diminutive guise, he is yet resolved to traverse the city as a man might, to better understand their plight and ensure that no quarter is left wanting."

Vrtra, the youngest, is perhaps the most prominent of late, owing to his long-standing relationship with the people of Thavnair.

Indeed, it was by the Forum\u0027s decree that, in response to the imperial invasion of Ala Mhigo, the Sharlayan colony in the Dravanian hinterlands was abandoned nearly overnight\u2500an event referred to by many as simply \u201Cthe exodus.\u201D\n\nIn addition to his political power, Fourchenault also wields authority as the patriarch of the Leveilleurs, one of Sharlayan\u0027s oldest families. Its lineage can be traced back to the nation\u0027s founders who arrived aboard \u003Ci\u003ENyunkrepf\u0027s Hope\u003C/i\u003E during the Sixth Umbral Calamity.

Desperate to ensure the twins escaped the coming apocalypse, he threw himself into his work with a determination bordering on obsession. The death of his own father, Archon Louisoix, during the Seventh Umbral Calamity only served to deepen his resolve.\n\nAs the Final Days drew closer, Fourchenault was consumed by fear for his children\u0027s safety and disapproval of their continued association with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. He vowed to get them aboard Sharlayan\u0027s ship by any means necessary, even should it cost him what remained of their already strained relationship. However, when the twins accomplished the impossible by optimizing the ship\u0027s aetherburner, he came to understand that their conviction would not be denied\u2500nor should it.

However, history would come to know him by another name: Zenos viator Galvus, kinslayer and outcast, whose misdeeds threw the Empire into a turmoil from which it would not escape.\n\nBlessed with martial and intellectual gifts, Zenos ever stood apart from his peers. He was raised among the sons and daughters of nobility in the hopes that he might find companions to advise him in his future role, but none proved his equal. Though the crown prince scorned the naivety of children and deemed his elders unworthy of respect, he eventually found joy in hunting\u2500in the primal desperation of the beasts who fought violently to survive. Zenos savored pitting his strength against theirs, and even after he became a military leader, this remained his sole pleasure.\n\nIt was after Zenos was appointed imperial viceroy of the provinces of Doma and Ala Mhigo that he would encounter prey of a different stripe: the Warrior of Light. Aided by the Eorzean champion and \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehis\u003C/If\u003E allies, a band of rebels grew bold enough to draw the crown prince\u0027s attention, leading to their first altercation at Rhalgr\u0027s Reach. Alas, the Warrior of Light was soundly defeated that day. While a subsequent clash in Doma resulted in a similar outcome, Zenos grew more fascinated with the beast he dubbed \u201Cthe champion of the savages,\u201D electing to spare \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehim\u003C/If\u003E a second time in the hopes \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eshe\u003CElse/\u003Ehe\u003C/If\u003E might grow into an even greater challenge.\n\nIn time, the Warrior of Light and \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehis\u003C/If\u003E allies led an army to Ala Mhigo, and with \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehis\u003C/If\u003E comrades engaged Zenos a third time within the Royal Palace. In that battle, the legatus realized that this was his first and only rival, and after luring \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehim\u003C/If\u003E to the gardens atop the palace, Zenos used his artificial Echo to become one with the captive primal, Shinryu. For the fourth time he fought his prey, but on this occasion the Warrior of Light emerged triumphant. Having experienced a transcendental joy beyond any he had ever known, Zenos took his own life, unwilling to live outside that fleeting moment.\n\nYet in embracing his stolen power, Zenos had rewritten his fate. His essence did not return to the Lifestream, but instead possessed the body of another. In a cycle akin to that of the immortal Ascians, the erstwhile prince leaped from vessel to vessel, until he found one with which he could return home to Garlemald. There he was reunited with his original form, which had been occupied for a time by the Ascian Elidibus, and was thus resurrected body and soul.\n\nHis first act following his return was to murder his own father. This was not out of malice, but jealousy\u2500Emperor Varis had set his sights on the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and Zenos was loath to share his quarry with another. For the returned prince, who had known the exultation of a warrior\u0027s death, the purpose of this new life was clear: to confront the only soul he would deign to call friend, and reclaim the bliss he had known only once before.\n\nAs Garlemald teetered on the verge of collapse, Zenos was approached by the Ascian Fandaniel, who laid bare the truth of the star. Together the two formed the Telophoroi, who schemed to usher in the Final Days. They sowed discord across the realm, channeling aether from the Lifestream into the Tower of Babil, that Zodiark Himself might be liberated from His lunar prison. In this they did succeed\u2500but before Zenos could seize control of the primal and battle the Warrior of Light, he was betrayed by Fandaniel, whose subsequent death at the hero\u0027s hand set in motion the Final Days. Zenos was still desperate for his long-desired rematch, but understood that the Warrior of Light was too distracted by the fate of the star to accept his challenge. And so, in disappointment he quit the field and vanished from the world\u0027s stage.\n\nZenos spent much of his self-imposed exile contemplating how he might obtain his heart\u0027s desire, but his answer proved simple. He would aid the Warrior of Light in \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehis\u003C/If\u003E struggle, and to that end he assumed the form of the dragon once more and flew to the edge of the universe. With Zenos\u0027s aid the threat to all life was laid low, and when the dust had settled, the Warrior of Light at last granted his wish.\n\nZenos viator Galvus now rests at the edge of the firmament, and none but the Warrior of Light can attest to his final moments."

Like those of his brethren, his name is in fact a title\u2500one of the exalted offices of the Convocation of Fourteen, the collective that guided mankind in ancient times.\n\nDuring the first Final Days, the seat was held by a man named Hermes, who prior to his induction served as chief overseer of Elpis, the testing ground of creation, and was an authority on flying life-forms as well as the celestial sphere. In the course of his work, however, Hermes came to question mankind\u0027s single-minded pursuit of perfection, prompting him to create Meteion and her sisters to seek the meaning of life in the distant stars. Alas, an accident caused them all to perish before they could fulfill their purpose...or so it was believed.\n\nIn truth, his creations found naught but despair, and concluded that salvation lay only in death. Furthermore, Meteion declared that she herself would usher in their demise. In a moment of madness, Hermes allowed her to pursue her designs, and erased the memories of those who knew what awaited\u2500his own included\u2500that mankind might be put to the proof and prove themselves capable of change and thus worthy of survival.\n\nIgnorant of his deeds, Hermes went on to oppose the Final Days with all his being, as he himself had intended. His knowledge proved instrumental in forestalling the Final Days, and the formulation of the plan to sacrifice half their number to manifest the mighty Zodiark. This first primal served to shield the star from Meteion\u0027s song of oblivion, but would later be sundered into fourteen parts alongside all creation by His counterpart, Hydaelyn.\n\nIronically, in forcibly erasing his memories, Hermes engraved them deeper upon his soul. In the millennia that followed, the cycle of death and rebirth would lead him to recall the forgotten truth: that the architect of the apocalypse abided at the edge of the universe.\n\nOne of the incarnations who inherited a shard of Hermes\u0027s tormented soul was a man named Amon, a brilliant technologist who rose to prominence in the Allagan Empire just as it was falling into decline. A victim of its prosperity, the empire had grown stagnant; the people delighted in debauchery, and science was no more than a means to amuse the decadent masses. Lamenting this state of affairs, Amon resolved to resurrect the founding father, Emperor Xande, that he might restore the empire to its former glory. And though he succeeded in his unholy endeavor, the emperor, having once experienced death, had been forever changed by the knowledge. Seeking to return all to nothingness, he set in motion events that would lead to the empire\u0027s undoing. But before Allag was consigned to oblivion, the Ascians, wishing to make use of Amon\u0027s singular talents, called him to serve as the new Fandaniel.\n\nIn receiving of the Ascian mantle, Fandaniel regained the missing pieces of his past and recalled the truth of the Final Days in its entirety. After the three unsundered Ascians met their ends, he forged an alliance with Zenos in order to take control of Zodiark. His heart was a maelstrom of righteous anger and all-consuming despair, twisted further by the remnants of the dreams that had haunted him as Amon\u2500of an ancient world rent asunder by a calamity well deserved.\n\nUltimately, he did not bear witness to the conclusion of the tale he had written. Having fallen as Zodiark, his soul was subsequently dragged into the depths of the aetherial sea by the spiteful Asahi, and he would never know if the Warrior of Light and \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehis\u003C/If\u003E comrades managed to overcome the despair that had broken him so utterly."

In the course of their efforts to counter the machinations of the Ascians, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn came to understand the true nature of their enemy. They learned that the cabal was comprised of thirteen prominent individuals: three \u201Cunsundered\u201D survivors of the Convocation of Fourteen, the council which had orchestrated the summoning of Zodiark in antiquity; and ten \u201Csundered\u201D souls\u2500fragments of members restored to their former offices.

Only then would Zodiark be freed of His chains, and the souls of the modern age be worthy of offering up in sacrifice."

A failed Ascian attempt to set in motion an Eighth Umbral Calamity on the Source triggered a Flood of Light, which then swept across the land, leaving naught but blank perfection in its wake.\n\nThe tale of the Flood is one of hubris and tragedy. Hoping to restore peace to an embattled world, brave Warriors of Light fought and felled the Shadowkeeper, steward of Darkness\u2500but in their decisive victory unbalanced the cosmic scales. Though Hydaelyn\u0027s agent, the Oracle of Light, managed to stem the ravenous tide and prevent the First\u0027s utter annihilation, much was lost.

Thus did the lands claimed by the Flood, known as the \u201CEmpty,\u201D come to reach a state of stasis utterly bereft of aetheric activity.

    "Unknown0": "Son of House Leveilleur, it was at the tender age of eleven that Alphinaud and his twin sister, Alisaie, were accepted into the prestigious Studium. There, he specialized in the study of arcane entities, history and natural history, and pursued advanced studies in the magical arts and aetherology. Upon graduating at sixteen, the Sharlayan age of adulthood, he resolved to sail for Eorzea in spite of his father\u0027s objections. Alphinaud has since worked to see his grandfather\u0027s wishes made reality. It is why he joined the Scions, and later why he founded the Crystal Braves. With the latter, however, the Ul\u0027dahn elite utilized Alphinaud\u0027s inflated confidence to their advantage, wresting the Braves from his control and delivering the young man a bitter defeat.\n\nSwallowing his despair, Alphinaud traveled with the Warrior of Light and Tataru to Ishgard, a nation locked in the thousand-year Dragonsong War. There he engaged with various factions and individuals who sought to resolve the conflict in their own way, among them Archbishop Thordan VII, Ser Aymeric, the Azure Dragoon Estinien, and the heretic Ysayle. The experience prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world as well as his purpose, and as the war neared its conclusion, he reached his own: he would not be a man who sacrifices friends and family for a cause. In spite of the risk to himself, he swore to rescue Estinien, who had been corrupted by the influence of Nidhogg\u0027s shade, and with the aid of the Warrior of Light succeeded in saving the dragoon\u0027s life.\n\nAlphinaud\u0027s involvement in the provincial rebellions that followed taught him further life lessons. He saw firsthand the crushing defeat dealt to the Ala Mhigan Resistance in Rhalgr\u0027s Reach by Zenos and the XIIth Imperial Legion. Undeterred, the young Scion then journeyed to the Far East with his comrades, braving haunted seas, and helped the Domans to free themselves from imperial rule. Having won an ally in Hien, Doma\u0027s rightful king, he returned to Eorzea to once more aid the Ala Mhigans in their fight against the Empire. At length the Eorzean Alliance laid siege to Ala Mhigo, where Zenos ruled as viceroy, and succeeded in vanquishing the imperial occupiers. With peace thus restored to the land, Alphinaud enjoyed a moment of adventure as he joined the Warrior of Light and fellow Scion Arenvald in a quest for lost treasure.\n\nIn the course of these experiences, Alphinaud learned of the Populares, a moderate faction in Garlean politics that sought to bring change to its provincial policy. Together with one of its members, a soldier named Maxima, he embarked on a diplomatic mission to the imperial capital. An unexpected attack en route put a premature end to his plans, but his subsequent chance meeting with Gaius led to another opportunity. Long thought dead, the former legatus had taken to working independently in the shadows, and their encounter resulted in an unlikely alliance that set in motion events which would alter the course of history.\n\nAfter coming to the First, Alphinaud applied himself earnestly and continued to ponder the true meaning of salvation. He did not shrink before Lord Vauthry, the godlike mayor of Eulmore, who believed himself to be mankind\u0027s sole deliverance, nor did he hesitate to voice his opposition when Emet-Selch revealed his intent to restore the past at the cost of the future. By these acts, he showed that the salvation that he had once striven to bring to others had transcended hollow ideals and become a tangible endeavor. And in the face of the Telophoroi threat in the Source, his long-held dream was realized with the formation of the Grand Company of Eorzea. With the combined might of not only the city-states but the myriad tribes besides, this organization united the realm in a way its ignominious precursor, the Crystal Braves, could not.\n\nAs he continued to walk his long path, Alphinaud was unexpectedly reunited with his father Fourchenault. In their first meeting since he left Sharlayan behind, he was made to question the wisdom of his course\u2500of going to war to effect change. But encouraged by his comrades, his sister Alisaie not least of all, he was able to find his answer: for those he holds dear, he would always choose to fight.\n\nEven now, with the Final Days averted, Alphinaud labors on behalf of those in need. And he will ever do so, forging ahead one step at a time towards the better tomorrow he envisions."

Though unmistakably a prodigy, she has, in their sixteen years together, always trailed ever so slightly behind him. Her grandfather, however, never treated her as secondary, and as such Alisaie clearly misses Louisoix dearly, still holding him in higher regard than any other.\n\nShortly after Alisaie gained admission to the Studium at the age of eleven, Louisoix resolved to return to Eorzea in order to save the realm from the Seventh Umbral Calamity. His son Fourchenault attempted to dissuade him, asserting that the wise abjure conflict, but the elder Archon responded with words that have remained in Alisaie\u0027s heart: \u201CTo ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom\u2500it is indolence. We must all protect that which we hold most dear in the manner of our own choosing.\u201D Louisoix upheld his creed to the end, and vanished amidst the fire and fury of the Calamity.\n\nWishing to know the fate of her beloved grandfather and what he had sacrificed himself for, Alisaie journeyed to Eorzea together with Alphinaud years later. Disappointment awaited her, as she found all the city-states struggling with fundamental problems, with none making any progress towards addressing them. Distancing herself from her brother and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who proactively aided the nations, she struck out on her own to investigate the truth of the Calamity\u2500and better understand the realm.\n\nIn the course of her solitary endeavors, Alisaie uncovered a scheme between the Warriors of Darkness and the Ascians, with her family friend Urianger somehow involved. Seeking to thwart their plot to sow chaos, as well as ascertain Urianger\u0027s allegiance, she made the decision to join with the Scions formally.\n\nSince then, Alisaie has fought fearlessly on the front lines. Taking up the rapier in place of the grimoire she received from her grandfather, she played a key role in the liberation of both Doma and Ala Mhigo before helping to save the First from all-consuming Light. Countless times has she been cast down, battered and discouraged, but never has she failed to rise up again and carry on the fight. And in the course of her struggles, she came to accept her grandfather\u0027s wisdom and likewise love the world that he gave his life to protect.\n\nDuring her time in the First, Alisaie tended to the Light-afflicted souls who were living out their days at the Inn at Journey\u0027s Head. Determined to save a boy named Halric, it was by her initiative that a cure for sin eater corruption was devised. The method was subsequently adapted into a treatment for tempering\u2500a condition long held to be irreversible\u2500and used to cure not only the koboldling Ga Bu, but the countless people whom the Telophoroi had transformed into the primal Anima\u0027s mindless thralls.\n\nIn the chaos of the Final Days as well, Alisaie showed unfaltering courage. When the enemy came in force, she charged into the fray; when souls wanted for succor, she rushed to their aid. In this way she lived up to her grandfather\u0027s words, protecting that which she holds dear in the manner of her own choosing.\n\nThrough it all, Alisaie\u0027s sights have never strayed from one individual: the Warrior of Light. Driven by the desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the hero, she strives to better herself that she may one day count herself \u003CIf(PlayerParameter(4))\u003Eher\u003CElse/\u003Ehis\u003C/If\u003E equal."

Until some fifty years ago, Garlemald was a remote and sparsely populated nation which held little more than a fraction of the northern continent of Ilsabard. But with the arrival of a technological golden age and the concurrent emergence of a brilliant young legatus, Solus Galvus, in the span of a single generation Garlemald established itself as one of the most formidable forces in all of Hydaelyn.\n\nGarlemald is unsurpassed in the field of magitek, a technology which it exploits with devastating effectiveness in warfare. Unperturbed by their lesser numbers, the Garleans went forth upon gigantic flying warships, bearing powerful weaponry the likes of which the world had never seen. One nation after the next fell before their relentless onslaught, first those of the northlands, followed by the sovereign states of the eastern continent, Othard. Employing suppression and conciliation in equal measure, Garlemald indoctrinated the peoples it conquered, thus integrating them into its ever-expanding territory. So it was that the Garlean Empire came into existence.\n\nIn the year 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, the Garleans brought their campaign of conquest to Eorzea, swiftly bringing the city\u2013state of Ala Mhigo to its knees. Yet following the subjugation of Ala Mhigo, the Empire suddenly ceased its aggressive expansion.\n\nFor a time, it seemed as though the Empire\u0027s complete subjugation of the world was all but inevitable. However, Emperor Solus\u0027s failing health and eventual death triggered a war of succession, and following a protracted campaign on Eorzean soil, Gaius van Baelsar and his XIVth Legion suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the newly unified Eorzean Alliance. Thus did cracks begin to appear in the Empire\u0027s armor, and as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn continued to intervene on behalf of the oppressed, the Garleans went on to lose control of Doma in the east and Ala Mhigo in the west. To compound their woes, the new emperor, Varis, had scarcely won the throne before he was slain by his son Zenos, who had an agenda all his own.\n\nZenos then colluded with the Ascian Fandaniel, and using his father\u0027s corpse as a medium, summoned forth the primal Anima. The imperial capital, which had become the stage for a bloody civil war, fell silent as nearly every soldier and civilian remaining was turned into a tempered slave.\n\nThough both Anima and the Telophoroi have since been eliminated, Garlemald struggles to recover from the devastation. The leaders of the subjugated territories bide their time, making no moves to resurrect the fallen Empire, and it remains to be seen what the future holds."

The twenty-four-year-old Garlean learned of the newly invented ceruleum engine, and saw great potential in it. His was the hand that guided the development of magitek weapons, and his the mind that devised tactics for these warmachina. Galvus also saw them integrated into the army, and so imbued the military with mechanical might.\n\nInnately ungifted in magic, the Garleans once relied upon mages recruited from foreign lands to bolster their armies. Not only did magitek free them from that dependence\u2500it transformed them into a machine of conquest."

Likewise, farming and rearing animals were possible only at certain times. The land, in other words, could not support a large populace. The Garleans multiplied slowly, and over time were forced to accept being few in number.\n\nThere was but one benefit to the frigid land\u2014its vast deposits of ceruleum. This deep-blue liquid burned as well as oil, and kept the hearth warm during the long, dark times of year. Indeed, had it not been for this natural resource, the Garleans would not have survived the severe winter cold. Yet, it was to be a long time before the advent of the ceruleum engine, and the Garleans realized what a boon this liquid was."

The facilities constructed there allowed his organization to thrive and perform research independent of the Sharlayan motherland, but this selfsame independence rendered them uniquely vulnerable to attack.

One day, he targeted an Elezen man who had come to the maritime city-state to study aether. Unbeknownst to Thancred, that man was Louisoix Leveilleur and just as the boy drew near, the Archon sent him flying to the cobbles. Caught red-handed, Thancred was certain he would be tossed onto one of the city-state\u0027s prison hulks. Instead, Louisoix offered him an alternative\u2500use his gods-given agility to aid his fellow man. Thus, the Midlander boy returned with the Archon to Sharlayan, and there began to study survival and intelligence gathering techniques. He became an expert in both, then an Archon, and then a member of the Circle of Knowing.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Seventh Umbral Calamity, Thancred was dispatched to Ul\u0027dah on a mission of paramount importance. He would work surreptitiously to undermine the interests of the Garlean Empire, who had begun preparations for a future campaign of conquest in Eorzea. In the course of his duties, he was present at a parade during which a goobbue broke free and rampaged through the city, resulting in the death of a man named Warburton. Though his identity as a double agent for the Empire and Ala Mhigan Resistance were of particular interest, Warburton\u0027s true legacy would be Ascilia, the daughter he left behind, and for whose welfare Thancred thenceforth felt personally responsible.\n\nWhile Thancred wanted to ensure Ascilia\u0027s safety and well-being, his responsibilities meant that he could not act as a proper guardian. The songstress F\u0027lhaminn instead adopted her, though Thancred made a point to visit when he could, as well as bestow upon her a new name to help hide her from her father\u0027s enemies. Thus did she come to be known as Minfilia Warde, and while she grew older over the years, a part of him always saw her as that crying child in the streets\u2500a daughter for whom Thancred should have done more.\n\nIn the wake of the Calamity, fate would see both Thancred and Minfilia join the Scions of the Seventh Dawn\u2500he as a member, and she as their leader. Thancred was instrumental in many of the Scions\u0027 victories, but the events that followed the bloody banquet would forever change him. While holding off pursuers with Y\u0027shtola during their escape from Ul\u0027dah, the mage cast a forbidden spell to facilitate a swift escape. There were consequences, however, and his journey through the Lifestream saw him lose his ability to properly control aether and magicks. Yet what pained him far more was the loss of Minfilia, who had gone missing in the chaos. His grief was further compounded when he learned she had been summoned to Hydaelyn\u0027s side to serve as the Word of the Mother, a vessel for the deity\u0027s will\u2500and one seemingly devoid of Minfilia\u0027s.\n\nThe two were reunited after the Scions\u0027 clash with Ardbert and the Warriors of Darkness, where Urianger called upon Hydaelyn to intercede on behalf of the First. Hearing this earnest appeal, the Word of the Mother appeared and resolved to journey with the fallen champions unto their world and save it from the Flood of Light. Though Hydaelyn spoke through her, Thancred realized to his relief that Minfilia was still present...but this joy was tempered by the understanding that they would soon part ways once more. Bitter though it was, Thancred accepted this outcome, for he knew that Minfilia would make him proud.\n\nThancred was the first of the Scions called to Norvrandt by the Crystal Exarch. After his arrival he learned of how the Word of the Mother had sacrificed herself, and of the existence of the Oracle of Light, a girl who had inherited Minfilia\u0027s name and soul both. To save her from a life of imprisonment, he breached the gaols of Eulmore and took her into hiding. He taught the Oracle how to fight and survive, and continued to care for her well after the other Scions joined him on the First. Though their relationship was complicated, no matter how daunting the foe, the two would stand together, for Thancred believed he had found in the Oracle another chance\u2500another daughter for the one he had lost. And when she found the strength to stand for herself and not be defined by Minfilia\u0027s legacy, Thancred would bestow upon her a new name: Ryne, his \u201Cblessing.\u201D\n\nNow returned to the Source, Thancred continues to fight for the future of the star Minfilia loved so much. He often travels with his boon companion, Urianger, who notes that Thancred has developed a habit of gazing at the night sky, a smile on his face as he considers the stars. Though one can only speculate what he is thinking in those moments, Urianger likes to believe his thoughts are of Ryne\u2500and that no matter the distance between them, in his heart they are never far apart."

To define what exactly He is, one must first define Light and Darkness\u2500polar opposites whose core components differ from the six main elements of which the star is composed.\n\nThe ancients classified Light as that which governs tranquility and stasis. It is a pure white energy bereft of color or movement, and in modern terminology, an element of this nature would be defined as \u201Cumbral.\u201D In contrast, Darkness was classified as that which spurs growth. It is an energy of deepest black\u2500a cacophony of life\u0027s myriad colors\u2500and contemporary scholars would define elements of this active nature as \u201Castral.\u201D As such, Zodiark is Darkness and activity given form, while Hydaelyn, who would be His undoing, was conceived as the embodiment of peace and Light everlasting. In the world unsundered, these concepts lacked any associations with good and evil; Light and Darkness were simply fundamental energies that coexisted in all things.\n\nApproximately twelve thousand years ago, a vast quantity of Darkness was required to forestall the coming of the Final Days, that its dynamic nature might ensure that the celestial currents of Etheirys did not stagnate. So it was that the ancients devised a plan to create a god who would embody Darkness itself, and at the order of the Convocation of Fourteen, half of the star\u0027s surviving population gave their lives to bring Zodiark into being.\n\nServing as the primal\u0027s heart was the emissary Elidibus. Though countless ancients sacrificed their physical aether and tethered their very souls to Zodiark, Elidibus, having judged his duties unfinished, created a reflection of himself to keep vigil over his allies. Zodiark\u0027s untold power averted disaster for a time...yet those who survived and had come to worship Him sought to perpetuate the cycle of sacrifice. They vowed to reap the new life they had sown in His name to resurrect those who had rendered up their essence to fuel the primal\u0027s summoning.\n\nVenat and her followers stood in opposition to Zodiark\u0027s faithful. Believing that a new generation should inherit Etheirys, they summoned forth Hydaelyn, a second primal born of collective sacrifice, with Venat to serve as Her heart. And so Hydaelyn brought Her tranquil Light to bear against Zodiark\u0027s relentless Darkness in a terrible battle. Hydaelyn narrowly emerged the victor, and with Her final strike sundered Zodiark and the star itself into fourteen shards. With Her enemy fragmented and too weak to resist, Hydaelyn created a moon for each shard\u2500a series of gaols in which the divided Zodiark would be sealed for all eternity.\n\nOutraged by the sundering of their world and their god, the Ascians\u2500those who had belonged to the Convocation of Fourteen\u2500resolved to revive Zodiark and restore the broken world to the paradise it once was. For millennia they plotted against Hydaelyn and Her followers, orchestrating events to achieve their ultimate goal, until one of their own chose to forsake this solemn charge.\n\nThe Ascian Fandaniel, upon regaining his memories and understanding his true nature, rejected his role in his brethren\u0027s machinations. After learning of Elidibus\u0027s defeat on the First, he resolved instead to destroy Zodiark. Using Garlemald as his base of operations, the rogue Ascian orchestrated the summoning of the primal Anima, who would siphon aether from across the star and direct it into the Tower of Babil. Utilizing the tower as an aetheric cannon, Fandaniel crippled the mechanisms on the moon which kept Zodiark imprisoned, and subsequently traveled there to seize control of the elder primal by offering himself as His new heart.\n\nThough the Ascian was laid low by the Warrior of Light, Fandaniel reveled in Zodiark\u0027s defeat, as his ultimate goal was the return of the Final Days. In a final act of defiance, Zodiark reached into His chest and shattered His own heart, consigning the elder primal to a permanent death.\n\nWith His demise on the Source, it is presumed that the reflections of Zodiark in other shards were destroyed as well, and the once-fettered souls of the ancients are finally free to return to the Lifestream."

    "Unknown0": "This young maiden of the First fought the sin eaters alongside the Warrior of Darkness, and played an instrumental role in restoring night to Norvrandt.\n\nIt is impossible to speak of Ryne without first speaking of the Oracle of Light, Minfilia. Approximately a century ago, when the Flood of Light threatened to engulf the First, the people of Nabaath Areng bore witness to a woman who single-handedly halted the encroaching radiance. Amidst the tumult, someone was heard crying out \u201CMinfilia\u201D\u2500and so it was that Norvrandt\u0027s mysterious savior was named.\n\nFifteen years later, when the Kingdom of Voeburt fell to sin eaters, a girl was discovered who could not be turned by their corruption. With her hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire, she bore an uncanny resemblance to the legendary Oracle. Inheriting her name, this Minfilia went on to be a beacon of hope in mankind\u0027s struggle against the sin eater threat, but as is the fate of many a soldier, she eventually fell in battle. Some years later, however, another girl would appear who possessed the same distinct features and immunity both. In this way the cycle continued, with a new Minfilia emerging as if to replace the one who had died before her.\n\nThis strange phenomenon was brought about by none other than the original Minfilia, the Antecedent of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who had journeyed from the Source to deliver the First from destruction. Having quelled the Flood, she began reincarnating into the bodies of suitable young girls so that the blessing of Light, the source of resistance to sin eater corruption, might endure. Those who were vessels for Minfilia\u0027s soul invariably manifested her features, serving to identify the bearer of the blessing.\n\nOnce Vauthry became supreme leader of Eulmore, however, the Oracle was deemed no longer necessary. In truth, Vauthry feared the Oracle and the hope she symbolized, and so he ordered General Ran\u0027jit to find and imprison the next Minfilia to appear. That girl was Ryne (though she was yet to be called thus), and she was locked up deep in the city\u0027s dungeon before she had seen five summers. For years she languished there, deprived of the opportunity to develop her powers, until she was rescued by Thancred, whom the Crystal Exarch had summoned from the Source.\n\nThe days that followed were filled with excitement and discovery for the young maiden. From Thancred she learned how to live and fight, and over time he became as a father to her. Yet even as she grew closer to him, she began to question his motivations for taking her under his wing. She came to believe it was the original Minfilia that he had sought to save\u2500that he would be happier if she surrendered her body to the woman\u0027s soul\u2500and the thought tormented her throughout her journey with the Warrior of Darkness.\n\nIn time, the moment of truth would arrive. Tracking down the remaining Lightwardens required that she harness greater power as the Oracle, and it was during a bitter confrontation with Ran\u0027jit that she finally found the strength of will to walk her own path. With Thancred laying his life on the line to secure her escape, she pressed on to inherit her namesake\u0027s power and arise as the Oracle in her own right. Driven by the desire to fulfill the legacy of those who went before her, she returned with her hair and eyes restored to their natural hues, and from the man who was her father in all the ways that mattered, she received the name by which she is now known.\n\nWith the Lightwardens that once plagued the realm no more, Ryne now dedicates her days to restoring life to the First. Be it bejeweled with stars or a brilliant blue, the sky never fails to remind her of journeys past as well as her family, whose love she feels no matter the distance between them."

Since forging their partnership with Highwind Skyways, the Ironworks has produced countless airships, and is largely responsible for the current era\u0027s convenience in sky travel.\n\nWhile Cid remains the president of the company in name, during his five-year absence following the Calamity, it was a woman named Jessie who saw to the everyday management of the Ironworks. It is said that she remains at the company\u0027s helm even now, as Cid\u0027s duties often lead him far afield, and hers was the hand that signed the contract enlisting former imperial tribunus and engineering prodigy Nero tol Scaeva into their ranks.\n\nWorking tirelessly by the motto \u201CFreedom through Technology,\u201D Cid and his fellow engineers have been a reliable source of innovation.

The sole individual he knew capable of such feats\u2500the Warrior of Light\u2500abided in the Source, and thus did he labor to adapt the Crystal Tower\u0027s cross-rift travel capabilities that he might bring the hero unto the First.\n\nSuccess proved elusive. Even after much time and effort, instead of the Warrior of Light, the Exarch ended up summoning their fellow Scions, and incompletely; only their souls successfully made the journey. Though he could weave for them something akin to corporeal forms, their actual bodies remained locked in slumber in the Source, and the connection between flesh and soul would eventually fail, resulting in death. To wit, it was imperative that he found a way to return his unintended guests safely home.\n\nWhen teleporting, an individual takes their possessions with them by virtue of recognizing those objects as extensions of the self. It was this mechanism that served as the basis of the solution. Receptacles would be created to hold each of the Scions\u0027 souls, which the Warrior of Light, who had been summoned whole and complete, would then carry back across the rift to the Source. The finished product, the spirit vessel, also drew inspiration from white auracite, Moenbryda\u0027s ingenious invention for capturing an Ascian soul.\n\nHowever, one other obstacle had to be overcome: the separation of mind and memory. While the two are intrinsically entwined like words writ upon parchment, the latter is wont to fade when the soul is placed into a vessel. In seeking to ensure that their memories remained intact, the companions looked to Allagan memory transference\u2500a technique which required that their spirit vessels be imbued with royal Allagan blood. This blood was provided by the Exarch himself, and it also served to turn these vessels into keys for controlling the Crystal Tower, whose operation was restricted to the ancient empire\u0027s rulers."

This signaled the beginning of a more diverse curriculum, the main trunk branching out to include mundane fields such as the natural sciences of astronomy and biology.

This situation is exacerbated by compound disciplines such as somanoutics\u2500combining the study of aetherology, sorcery, and medicine\u2500the introduction of which leads to no few students transferring between faculties during their academy career.\n\nNow unburdened by the threat of the Final Days, administrators have seized the opportunity to enact changes.

    "Unknown0": "The Source has been visited by seven cataclysmic events known as \u201CUmbral Calamities.\u201D The first of these was the Calamity of Wind, followed by the Calamities of Lightning, Fire, Earth, Ice, Water, and finally the Calamity of Darkness. While these disasters may seem the logical consequence of conflict or natural phenomena, they could not, in truth, have occurred without a massive disruption of the aetherial equilibrium of a reflection world. When a reflection\u0027s balance shifts drastically towards a single aspect, the heightened elemental energies seep into the Source\u2500much as water flows from higher to lower ground. An influx of fire-aspected aether might cause extended droughts, for example, while ice could result in a widespread drop in temperature. These anomalies become increasingly common, until a final great catastrophe breaks down the barrier between the two worlds. In that moment, all the aether which comprises the reflection floods into the Source, and the catastrophe swells into a full-fledged Umbral Calamity.\n\nThough it did not take place within our present timeline, the Eighth Umbral Calamity\u0027s origin can be traced back to the First, where the power of Light was ascendant. Even as the luminous excess bled into the Source, the Garlean Empire launched its Black Rose upon the battlefield, and the deadly gas\u2500itself a weapon of a Light-based nature\u2500was amplified far beyond its expected potency. It spread over a vast area, halting the circulation of aether and killing every living being with which it came into contact. The aether currents themselves were stilled, and the repercussions of this stagnation rippled throughout the environment. The Alliance leaders and Scions who had gathered to fight the imperial armies were slain where they stood.\n\nThus began an age of unending war. Order broke down, violence ran rampant, and all fought in the savage battle for survival. In the midst of civilization\u0027s collapse, it was Cid and his Garlond Ironworks\u0027 stalwarts who led the development of an ambitious and far-reaching plan. Founded upon the knowledge they had gleaned in preceding years, the group set out to create a reality in which the Eighth Umbral Calamity never happened\u2500to build a past in which the calamity was prevented, and ensure that the fallen heroes survived into the future.\n\nThe engineers and their collaborators toiled for generations, devoting their lives and the lives of their descendants to bringing this mad scheme to fruition. Finally, after decades of preparation, they succeeded in transporting the reawoken Crystal Tower backwards through the years and into the world of the First.\n\nMany adventures and misadventures later, Darkness was restored to the ailing reflection, and the Eighth Umbral Calamity was averted. None who live today bore witness to that tragedy, nor the great effort which went into making this miracle possible. None will ever know who their saviors were, nor the thoughts and fears which drove them. None will ever know if their bleak future was erased by the changing of history, or if it endures in a fork of time\u0027s eternal river. Here and now, their hopes for the world are evident only in the continued survival of those they gave everything to save."

Tragedy arrived, however, when Ascians enveloped the lands in Darkness in their attempt to shatter the barrier between the worlds and force a Rejoining. The first step of their machinations involved sharing the secrets of primal summoning and instigating wars of conquest. Heroes possessed of preternatural talents came forth to do battle, employing an art that sealed the primals away in crystal \u201Cmemoria.\u201D They then drew on the memoria\u0027s power to tip the balance and quell the conflicts for good, but from these champions arose new tyrants, intoxicated by the strength they now wielded. One by one, the heroes fell, the tides turned, and the catastrophic shift in aetherial equilibrium triggered a Flood of Darkness.\n\nYet even greater disaster was to come when the Ascians\u0027 Rejoining failed to channel the surfeit of Darkness unto the Source. Having nowhere else to which it could escape, these energies surged and swelled until it engulfed the Thirteenth entirely, transforming every living being on the star into twisted fiends. All that was left was a grasping void, where even the surcease of death was denied its inhabitants.\n\nEver since this inundation of Darkness, the veil separating worlds has been notably thinner between the Source and the void, more so than with any other reflection. Forging a passage via natural fissures or man-made gates is comparatively simple, and voidsent incursions\u2500be they the result of deliberate summonings or otherwise\u2500are a frequent occurrence."

Zero was thus born half-voidsent, and ceased to age after reaching adulthood. She chose to take up her mother\u0027s struggle to bring an end to the Contramemoria, but while traveling as a lone hero, she was bested by a band of corrupt memoriates. The Flood of Darkness inundated the world even as she lay dying, sweeping her soul into the rift between worlds.\n\nWhen an incidental fissure at last allowed her to return, she found her world an empty void, uninhabitable by any being that was not a voidsent. Zero surrendered to hopelessness, condemned as she was to wander alone for eternity.\n\nAlthough strong enough to manifest her own territory in the swirling mire, Zero rarely visited her \u201Chome\u201D unless her aether reserves were low. It instead became a sanctuary for lesser voidsent who had grown tired of the endless battle for dominance\u2500an intrusion she tolerated without protest.\n\nSeeking an advantage against the Warrior of Light, it was Zenos who summoned Zero to the Source and bound her to serve as his reaper avatar. With his defeat, she was cast back unto the void, where she would once again encounter Eorzea\u0027s champion and their companions when they came in search of the great wyrm Azdaja. They gave her the name \u201CZero,\u201D and struck a bargain to enlist her aid in their battle against Golbez\u0027s archfiends. As they traveled and fought together, Zero began to reconnect with a part of herself she had thought forever lost, and the discovery of how Light might be restored to her world rekindled a fire within her breast. Zero soon abandoned the pretense of payment and accompanied the Warrior of Light of her own accord, forging bonds of friendship with Jullus and many others in a way that she had shunned when fighting alone.\n\nThe quest to defeat Zeromus would eventually take her to the First to meet with Ryne, the Oracle of Light. Ryne\u0027s words gave Zero much to consider, and after contemplating what her half-voidsent nature allowed her to do that no other being could, she took within herself the power of Light.\n\nZero then returned to the void to confront Golbez in the depths of the moon. Golbez, too, had desired to restore the Thirteenth, but in his grief at losing his dear companion, he had been manipulated by the Ascians into unleashing the Flood of Darkness. So it was that Zero revealed to him the flicker of Light she carried, convincing the would-be conqueror that a seed of hope yet remained. During the ensuing battle with Zeromus, Zero\u0027s fervent wish to save her world transformed her into a knight of legendary appearance. A blow infused with both Light and Darkness shattered Zeromus\u0027s form, and Zero succeeded in sealing the massive voidsent\u0027s aether in memoria. Following their triumph, she joined hands with the repentant Golbez, and together they took the first steps toward bringing Light into the void.\n\nWary of diluting her essence, Zero has always avoided feeding on the souls of others. This insistence on consuming stray aether often led to her death through starvation, leaving her to drift in the void until her corporeal form was reconstituted. After not eating physically for so long, Zero\u0027s sense of taste had also atrophied\u2500but she has since rediscovered this facet of cuisine after sampling heavily spiced foods in the Source. The extremely spicy curry custom-made to her preference in Radz\u2013at\u2013Han has become one of the city\u0027s new signature dishes."

The Mamool Ja have previously sought to force this miracle, desiring advantage in their historical conflict against the Xbr\u0027aal, but the commingling of the Hoobigo and Boonewa lines was fraught with complications: for every healthy blessed sibling born, a hundred infants failed to survive.\n\nBefore Gulool Ja Ja\u0027s feet, too, were set firmly on the path of war, he was fortunate to encounter the Eorzean explorer, Ketenramm. The friendship he forged with the outsider opened his eyes to the world beyond the forest, encouraging him to depart Mamook and its restrictive traditions. He traveled far and wide across the lands of Tural, meeting its diverse races and cultivating new companions along the way. His was a tale of unprecedented adventures, which culminated in the defeat and imprisonment of Valigarmanda, the Skyruin.\n\nFollowing these accomplishments, Gulool Ja Ja returned to Yak T\u0027el with his comrades in tow, whereupon they challenged the warring Mamool Ja and Xbr\u0027aal forces. The two-head\u0027s fellowship thoroughly humbled both armies, leading to a cessation of hostilities and a lasting peace.\n\nWord of Valigarmanda\u0027s defeat and the end of the Yak T\u0027el war spread swiftly to every corner of the continent. The philosophy of cooperation espoused by Gulool Ja Ja begat a rising tide of like-minded sentiment, paving the way for the foundation of Tuliyollal and elevating him to the position of \u201CDawnservant.\u201D As the new nation\u0027s ruler, his bold and ebullient right head would lead their armies as the Vow of Resolve, whilst his wise and benevolent left head would govern their myriad peoples as the Vow of Reason. Under this balanced leadership did he henceforth guide the fledgling federation into a state of great prosperity.\n\nAs a two-headed Mamool Ja, Gulool Ja Ja was thought incapable of siring children. Some decades after his ascension to the throne, however, the Dawnservant was blessed with the arrival of a son: Zoraal Ja. And as if precipitated by this unprecedented event, Gulool Ja Ja went on to adopt the orphaned Koana and Wuk Lamat, one promptly after the other. With the royal family thus expanded, the Dawnservant turned his hand to raising his heirs\u2500the First, Second, and Third Promises.\n\nYet even the greatest of potentates cannot outrun old age forever. Unwilling to allow his inevitable passing to plunge the nation into chaos, Gulool Ja Ja took inspiration from the old ways of Mamook to devise a rite of succession. He watched over Wuk Lamat and Koana as they became joint rulers of Tuliyollal, and it was during the ascension ceremony that he confirmed their suspicions: the constantly slumbering Head of Reason had passed quietly from this world some three years before.\n\nGulool Ja Ja\u0027s saga came to a tragic end when soldiers of Alexandria later attacked the capital. The former Dawnservant faced off against the invasion force\u0027s commander\u2500his own son, Zoraal Ja\u2500in single combat, seemingly defeating the treacherous Promise. Using regulator technology, however, Zoraal Ja arose stronger than before and slew his father in cold blood."

This partial rejoining caused a temporal anomaly, its nature such that while mere moments had passed outside, those trapped within had lived through thirty years. During those lost decades, Queen Sphene, ruler of the dome\u0027s people, joined hands with Zoraal Ja.

    "Unknown0": "A tural vidraal is a rare example of when a creature of advanced age evolves far beyond the usual limits of its species. Meaning \u201Cland grasper\u201D in the common tongue, the term well describes how the monstrous power of these entities comes to dominate the region in which they dwell.\n\nThe existence of several tural vidraal have been recorded to date, but even among these anomalies, the infamous Valigarmanda was unrivaled in strength. It was dubbed the \u201CSkyruin,\u201D a name earned for the destruction it visited upon Tural every time it stirred from slumber. Valigarmanda\u0027s reign of terror continued until eight decades past, when Gulool Ja Ja and his company of heroes subdued the beast and sealed it within the Yok Huy temple of Karryorzar the Gracious.\n\nThe Skyruin awakened one last time during the rite of succession, its prison of ice unmade by the reckless actions of Bakool Ja Ja. Fortunately for the region\u0027s inhabitants, the Mamool Ja\u0027s rival candidates and their champions rose to the challenge. Upon the field of battle did they come together to slay the scourge of Urqopacha, and write the final chapter to its legend."

    "Unknown0": "The Storm Surge is the name given to the great conflict that raged in the Ninth some four hundred and fifty years ago. Engulfing the Kingdom of Alexandria and other major powers of the age, it brought the entire world to the brink of destruction.\n\nThe impetus for the Storm Surge was an anomalous shift in the star\u0027s aether, which saw lightning energy grow ever more abundant. This gave rise to a tumultuous rainy season that lengthened with each passing year, causing crops and livestock alike to wither for want of sunlight. As desperation drove the people to search for a solution, a singular ore was discovered that had apparently manifested as a result of the aetheric imbalance. Later dubbed electrope, this ore had the ability to absorb and contain lightning, and by etching arcane circuits upon it\u2500a technique derived from the knowledge of the Milalla people\u2500it could convert the stored energy into any of the other elements. With this development, electrope became a miraculous material that found use in countless applications.\n\nIn those early days, however, electrope was a scarce resource. Seeking to secure sufficient reserves, nations fought over the precious ore, with sporadic skirmishes inevitably escalating into open war. Predictably, electrope too came to be employed on the battlefield, and in an act of madness, the nation of Lindblum deployed a doomsday weapon that devastated the star\u0027s aetheric balance, triggering a disaster the equal of any umbral calamity. So it was that the Storm Surge, which had already claimed innumerable lives, came to its conclusion, with no nation the victor. The Kingdom of Alexandria alone barely escaped annihilation, and afterwards was flooded with refugees from nearby lands."

Nevertheless, it suffered tremendous devastation, with great swaths of its territory submerged by endless rains.\n\nAgainst this dire backdrop, a collective of scientists known as Preservation announced a plan to build a great tower over the royal palace, within which survivors might take shelter from the rising waters. It was a project of unprecedented scale, but through the extensive and innovative use of electrope, what was thought impossible became possible. Over the following centuries, additional elements were added to the structure, with sectors for primary and secondary industries constructed beside residential areas, until it grew into its present form, with all the facilities needed not only for people to survive, but to thrive.\n\nEventually, life within Everkeep became so advanced that the populace could enjoy indulgences like an amusement park, which was opened on the uppermost level. Later, however, when the method for recreating the departed from preserved memories was perfected, the park was renamed Living Memory and repurposed as a home for the Endless. This level alone remained in the Ninth when interdimensional fusion was employed to join Alexandria to the Source."

Its founders were Krile\u0027s birth parents, Robor and Alayla, former members of Preservation who opposed Calyx\u0027s plan to invade other worlds. Once the then-infant Krile was targeted for experimentation, the researcher couple seized the key to interdimensional fusion and used it to deliver both the artifact and their child to the Source to keep them safe from the enemy. They vanished from record thereafter, with their Endless incarnations later encountered in Living Memory.\n\nDeprived of their founders, Oblivion effectively ceased to be\u2500until decades later when its secret headquarters, now known as the Backroom, was discovered by Cahciua and her followers. Although detailed information pertaining to the key had been erased, Cahciua, strongly believing in Oblivion\u0027s purpose, reestablished the organization under its original name. With the Yyasulani native at the helm, its members set out to thwart King of Resolve Zoraal Ja\u0027s ambitions for conquest."

    "Unknown0": "An electrope device issued to citizens of Alexandria, the regulator boasts various remarkable capabilities. Chief among them is the ability to resurrect the wearer by imbuing them with life force extracted from other souls in the event of unanticipated death. This has allowed the people to live out the span of their natural lives, provided they have sufficient surplus souls. By way of a similar mechanism, souls can also be harnessed to temporarily enhance one\u0027s physical prowess, this usage being common among those in dangerous occupations such as soldiers, hunters, and arena fighters.\n\nAdditionally, regulators have the ability to manipulate the wearer\u0027s memories, a function that served twofold purposes: to remove all memories pertaining to death, thereby sparing Alexandrians the fear of mortality, and to preserve the memories of the departed as data. This data would thence be used in the creation of an Endless version of the individual.\n\nSuch a powerful and ubiquitous device, however, could be misused by those with influence. This was made evident with the neo regulators, whose adoption Calyx encouraged by having the simulant, an impostor of the fallen Queen of Reason, declare that only their wearers could become Endless. By concurrently limiting the device\u0027s availability, Calyx cultivated heightened terror towards death among the populace\u2500terror which he exploited to manifest the dread primal Necron.\n\nFollowing Calyx\u0027s defeat, the government of Alexandria took steps to unlock the memories of the departed within citizens who so desired. What regulators have taken away, regulators shall restore."
